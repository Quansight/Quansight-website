00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
An undulating function is shown plotted in 3D. The function is slowly spinning.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The camera zooms out to show the function from a top-down view.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A square white mesh covers a portion of the top of the function. A formula shows the integral of f(x, y) over the intervals [-2, 2] for x and [-2, 2] for y. Text appears which says "Subdivide!".

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The mesh and "Subidivide!" text disappears. A new mesh where the original was appears in 4 sections, fading in from a clockwise direction. This mesh is finer than the original mesh. Text appears on the top right section which says "Subdivide!" again.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The top right section of the mesh and the "Subdivide!" text disappears. A new mesh where the original top right section was appears again, fading in from a clockwise direction.
