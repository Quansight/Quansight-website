00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A univariate function is plotted on axes extending upwards and to the right. A trapezium is lightly drawn over the function, and meets the function at the start and end of where it has been plotted. The text "Subdivide!" appears on top of the trapezium.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The trapezium fades out and is replaced by two new trapeziums, which now cover the original function in two sections meeting at the middle. The text "Subdivide!" appears on top of the right-hand trapezium.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The right-hand trapezium fades out and is replaced by two more trapeziums in its place. Now three trapeziums cover the function in total. The text "Subdivide!" appears on top of the last trapezium.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The last trapezium fades out and is replaced by two more trapeziums in its place. Now four trapeziums cover the function in total.
