For 2024, 15 did not consider themselves to belong to a marginalized group, 11 self-identified as belonging to a marginalized group, and 2 preferred not to self-identify.  For 2023, 12 did not consider themselves to belong to a marginalized group, 8 self-identified as belonging to a marginalized group, and 3 preferred not to identify. For 2022, 15 did not consider themselves to belong to a marginalized group, eight self-identified as belonging to a marginalized group, and two preferred not to identify. For 2021, 16 did not consider themselves to belong to a marginalized group, and 11 self-identified as belonging to a marginalized group.
