It is SciPy this week! It's one of the biggest community events in our corner of the world. We are so excited for the festivities, the talks, and to see & hear all our friends' new ideas.

Events, and technology, are increasingly more complex these days. This year SciPy is in-person and virtual, and we wanted to bring y'all two things that fit these constraints:

1. We're introducing a pilot open source [scavenger hunt](#the-scavenger-hunt) where you can:
   1. Contribute to popular open source projects.
   2. Improve the alt text of open source documentation.
2. A free digital _and limited print_ zine called [__How to Write Alt Text for Scientific Diagrams and Visualization__][zine] by [@marsbarlee](https://github.com/marsbarlee).

## The scavenger hunt.

First, we need to acknowledge the four projects participating in this pilot:

1. Project Jupyter[^1]
2. SciPy
3. Dask
4. Bokeh

Thank y'all for taking the time to prepare for the scavenger hunt, and wanting to improve your documentation.

## How to participate.

- Follow each link/code to a pull request.
- Follow the pull request instructions to modify the respective alt text in markdown or rst format, as appropriate.

| JupyterLab [^1]     | SciPy                 | Dask                | Bokeh                 |

## Why participate?

- _low barrier to entry_ to participate in open source projects
- _improve the accessibility of open source documentation_
- _learn more about alt text_

## What next?

- Start submitting and improving your alt text!
  - [Working Jupyter alt text guide](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-accessibility-workshops/blob/main/docs/alt-text-guide.md#diagrams-charts-plots)
  - [Chartability heuristics for accessible visualizations](https://chartability.fizz.studio/)
- Stay tuned later this week to learn how you fight inaccessibility with our zine release.
- Use more alt text in your social media and documentation.
- Give the project maintainers time to merge your submissions.
- Enjoy [__How to Write Alt Text for Scientific Diagrams and Visualization__][zine]

[^1]: These alt text events, which started in Project Jupyter, have been a community mainstay for over a year. In these [low-code workshops](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2021/09/low-code-contributions-through-github) we have been able to remove the complexities of git in contributing to open source and thus expand participation. These events have been run [in the past with several communities](https://github.com/isabela-pf/a11y-events/tree/main/workshop-resources/alt-text#past-events).
