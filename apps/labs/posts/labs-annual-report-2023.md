    Section heading: Our mission
    The mission of Quansight Labs is to sustain and grow community-driven open source projects and ecosystems, with a focus on the core of the PyData stack and on tools and digital infrastructure for data science, ML/AI, and scientific computing.
    Section heading: Our Community
    We worked on 30+ open-source projects
    Logos for Ray, SymPy, Project Jupyter, stdlib, Spyder, Bokeh, conda-forge, DataAPIs, PyTorch Ignite, Open Source Design, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, nd[index], Numba, Hypothesis, NumPy, Matplotlib, Python, IPython, NumFOCUSâ€™ Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing, and Napari.
    These projects reached ~20 million people worldwide
    We spent 12,500+ hours contributing to open source projects
    A plot shows hours spent on OSS projects: 12,600 hours in 2022, compared to 7,800 hours in 2021.
    And organized 230+ hours of community meetings
    We supported NumFOCUS with $30,000 to keep our ecosystem healthy
    A plot shows donations to NumFOCUS: $34,130 donated in Q4 2021 - Q3 2022, compared to Q4 202 - Q3 2021
    Section heading: Our Culture
    Labs is a public-benefit and remote-first organization, with a globally distributed team.
    We brought our team together in 2 continent-wide in-person meetups in Austin (US) and Italy.
    Equity, diversity, and inclusion are at the core of everything we do.
    We encourage asynchronous and handbook-driven work, and emphasize clear documentation and explicit social rules.
    We had an 8%+ increase in representation of employees belonging to a marginalized group in tech
    A plot shows gender identity: 11.5% of employees identify as Other, 15% as a Woman, and 73% as a Man.
    A plot shows LGBTQAI+ self-identification: 80% of employees said No, while 20% said Yes.
    A footnote describes that the gender data includes employees who have self-identified as a man or a woman. Those who self-identified outside the gender binary (man/woman)  are counted in the Other category to avoid individual identification as we honor their choice not to be restricted by a binary system.
    50% of employees have been part of Labs for 2 years or more
    A plot shows time working at Labs: 32% of employees have worked at Labs for 3+ years, 20% for 2-3 years, 28% for 1-2 years, and 20% for less than 1 year.

At Labs, we're just one part of a vast and vibrant open source community. We'd like to thank everyone who supports our ecosystem, even through some challenging times in the tech industry, and we look forward to a promising year ahead!
