    Section heading: Our mission
    The mission of Quansight Labs is to sustain and grow community-driven open source projects and ecosystems, with a focus on the core of the PyData stack and on tools and digital infrastructure for data science, ML/AI, and scientific computing.
    Section heading: Our Community
    We worked on 35+ open-source projects
    Logos for conda, Hypothesis, Numba, SciPy, JupyterLab, Napari, SymPy,  scikit-learn, Bokeh, IPython,  NumPy, Panel, Cython, DataAPIs, JAX, PyTorch, pandas, Nebari, conda-store, CuPy, PaPyri, PyData Sphinx Theme, conda-forge, Polars, OpenBLAS, CPython, PyTorch Ignite, Spyder, Project Jupyter, Matplotlib, Meson, stdlib, NumFOCUS’ Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing, and the Python Software Foundation.
    We worked on community-driven open source projects for 38,000+ hours, out of which, ~22% were directly funded by Quansight Labs
    A plot shows hours spent per funding source, where 30087 hours were externally funded and 8321 hours were Labs funded
    Section heading: Inside Labs
    Our 2023 focus areas: Python packaging, Access-centered practices, Multiple library support
    Following a co-ownership approach to governance, senior Labs members shared ownership and accountability for particular focus areas
    In the 3rd iteration of our open source internship program, we welcomed 6 interns
    A plot shows that in 2023, 2022, and 2021, the internship program had 12, 11, and 8 mentors, and 6, 6, and 7 interns, respectively.
    For the long-term sustainability of our ecosystem, we ensure: Funds follow community roadmaps and decisions, and work is done transparently; Investment in foundational infrastructure (e.g., packaging) and initiatives (e.g., interoperability); Maintenance and holistic contributions to Open Source projects (documentation, UI/UX design, community, and more)
    Finally, we’re glad to share that 55% of our employees have been part of Labs for 2 years or more.
    A plot shows time working at Labs, where 26% respondents have worked at Labs for under 1 year, 17% between 1-2 years, 21% between 2-3 years, and 34% for 3 years or more.
