[CuPy](https://cupy.dev/), the NumPy/SciPy-compatible array library for
GPU-accelerated computing, is getting better every release. In this post, we'll
take a deep dive into the new interpolation and signal processing capabilities
that our team has been adding to CuPy.

For those who are not familiar with the project, CuPy has several unique
features making it an excellent choice for numerical computation. First, CuPy
is a drop-in replacement for NumPy and SciPy and used to perform numerical
computation on GPUs, thus allowing developers to create, manipulate, and
operate on larger n-dimensional arrays faster than they can on CPUs. As a
drop-in replacement, CuPy helps users without knowledge of GPU programming
accelerate their existing pipelines, while also accommodating more experienced
programmers who want to write low-level GPU routines directly in Python.
Second, CuPy conveniently integrates with popular Deep Learning frameworks,
such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, and allows developers to efficiently deploy new
operators, modules, and functions. And lastly, CuPy is flexible with respect to
the hardware used, allowing kernel execution not just on NVIDIA GPUs
(via CUDA), but also on AMD GPUs. Support for AMD GPUs is thanks to the
HIP integration effort pushed during the past year, thus making CuPy a
universal, vendor-free library that can be used regardless of the
GPU accelerator available.

Over the past few years, CuPy's compatibility with NumPy has improved to the
point that most commonplace and popular APIs are now available, including
n-dimensional array creation, operation, and manipulation, linear algebra,
fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and statistics. Given the great progress in
replicating the NumPy API on GPU, the next step was to port the extensive SciPy
API to support GPUs, as well. This has led to several improvements, such as
sparse array support and spatial computation.

Porting SciPy APIs is a significant undertaking. Until recently, there were
several modules, such as interpolation and signal processing, that were missing
or had a partial API coverage and are critical in scientific
applications like image and audio processing, weather, radar and spectral analysis,
as well as computational chemistry and sensor design. Given this interest, a
joint CZI grant (EOSS Cycle 5) was proposed between
[Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred.jp/en/) and Quansight Labs in order
to reduce the gap between SciPy and CuPy and to specifically port most of the
APIs available in the `scipy.interpolate` and `scipy.signal` namespaces.

During the first year of the grant work, a team of developers at Quansight Labs
have teamed up with CuPy maintainers at Preferred Networks to increase the
coverage of interpolation and signal processing subpackages, where, as of CuPy
pre-release 13.0.0b1, 18 interpolation and more than 100 signal APIs are now
available, including basis splines, regular grid interpolation, and piecewise
polynomials for the interpolation module and IIR linear filtering,
filter design, linear time invariant systems, and peak finding for the
signal processing subpackage.

As expected, all the ported APIs afford a significant performance increase
relative to the SciPy CPU reference implementations by exploiting the parallel
nature of GPU kernels (whereas CPU implementations are sequential).
For example, the new CuPy `BSpline` implementation has a nearly 10x performance
improvement when compared to its corresponding implementation in SciPy,
and `PPoly` has a 32x performance improvement, representing a huge enhancement
over CPU implementations.

For those APIs which could not be readily ported from CPU to GPU, new
implementations were derived from scientific papers, including the new IIR
linear filtering routines, which represent the first time IIR filters can be
applied on GPUs from Python. As part of this process, some enhancements and
simplifications were also backported to SciPy, such as a major refactor of
symmetric IIR filters to leverage IIR linear filtering and second order sections
rather than dedicated routines which contained duplicate code.

The following example demonstrates the new capabilities of CuPy in filtering
multiple signals in parallel using a GPU. For illustrative purposes, we begin
by defining four different signals.

```python
import cupy as cp
from cupyx.scipy import signal
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

rng = cp.random.default_rng(seed=1234)
t = cp.linspace(-1, 1, 201)
t = cp.broadcast_to(t, (4, 201)).copy()
phase = 10 * rng.random((4, 1)) - 5

# Define 4 random signals composed of a main component with quadratic time
# input and two sinusoids with 1.25Hz and 3.85Hz frequencies, plus a DC component.
main_x = cp.sin(2 * cp.pi * 0.75 * t * (1 - t) + 2.1 + phase)
```

    a signal in the time domain, the signals where generated by a sine wave with

    plus a DC component"

    component.

</figure>

Next, let’s add some noise to the example signals.

```python
# Introduce linear noise into the original signal.
x = (main_x +
    0.1 * cp.sin( 2 *cp.pi * 1.25 * t + 1) +
    0.18 * cp.cos(2 * cp.pi * 3.85 * t))
xn = x + rng.standard_normal(t.shape) * 0.08

# Make sure that input is float32, since it yields a better performance
xn = xn.astype(cp.float32)
```

<figure>
  <img
    src="/posts/cupy-czi-grant-year1/noisy_signals.png"
    alt="A grid of four plots, arranged in a 2x2 configuration. Each plot denotes
    the noisy signals used for the example."

  />
  <figcaption style={{textAlign: "center"}}>

</figure>

Now that we’ve generated our signals, time for the fun part! Let’s do some filtering!
In doing so, we’ll extract the noise from each signal using the new signal
parallel-processing APIs available in CuPy, namely `lfilter` and `filtfilt`.
For purposes of comparison, we’ll compare applying `lfilter` once, applying
`lfilter` twice, and filtering in both forward and reverse directions
using `filtfilt`.

```python
# Create a third-order, Butterworth low-pass filter with cutoff at 0.05.
b, a = signal.butter(3, 0.05)
b = b.astype(cp.float32)
a = a.astype(cp.float32)

# Compute the steady-state response of the filter.
zi = signal.lfilter_zi(b, a)
zi = zi.reshape(1, -1)
zi = zi.astype(cp.float32)

# Filter out the 1.25Hz and 3.85Hz components and remove the noise on all signals in parallel.
z, _ = signal.lfilter(b, a, xn, zi=zi * xn[:, 0, None])

# Apply the filter again.
z2, _ = signal.lfilter(b, a, z, zi=zi*z[:, 0, None])

# Use filtfilt on all signals in parallel.
y = signal.filtfilt(b, a, xn)
```

A plot comparing filtering results is displayed below. By visual inspection
(and rather cursory analysis!), we can conclude that `filtfilt` does a better
job at recovering the original signals.

    the result of taking a noisy signal, applying the lfilter and filtfilt CuPy
    in the following order: lfilter once, lfilter twice and filfilt. The filtfilt
    results reconstruct the original signal with higher fidelity."

As part of this effort, we made several other improvements to other CuPy modules,
such as adding special functions for elliptic filters, implementing the
matrix exponential in the `cupyx.scipy.linalg` namespace, and implementing
KD-Trees in `cupyx.scipy.spatial`.

This work would not have been possible without the help of the
[cuSignal](https://github.com/rapidsai/cusignal) team at the NVIDIA RAPIDS
initiative, who agreed to migrate the implementations of over 36 APIs from their project to
CuPy, thus unifying the GPU signal processing efforts currently available
in the ecosystem. As part of this migration, cuSignal will be deprecated and
replaced by the new `cupyx.scipy.signal` module calls. The calls will be
interchangeable by simply replacing the `cusignal` imports with imports from
`cupyx.scipy.signal`.

As the grant enters its second year, we plan to finish the overall
interoperability of the interpolation module, which first requires a
significant refactor of several FORTRAN routines for spline smoothing into GPU
kernels and, second, implementing computational geometry routines to compute
convex hulls and Delaunay triangulations, which are used for interpolating
multi-dimensional unstructured data. This work will further enhance overall
CuPy-SciPy compatibility.

These new APIs will open a sea of possibilities in terms of acceleration and
batch processing of data, and we hope they will be useful to the CuPy community.
Right now, these additions are being pre-released as part of the beta releases
of the upcoming CuPy v13.0. We invite you to keep an eye on our tracking issues
