    Hi, my name is Kristian Minchev. In this blog post, I will be talking about my
    experience as a summer intern at Quansight Labs working on enhancing NumPy
    support in Numba. In particular, my work was focused on adding support for the
    `Polynomial` class as well as other functions from the polynomial API.

## What is Numba?

[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is a just-in-time compiler for Python that
translates a subset of Python and NumPy into fast machine code. The most common
way to use Numba is through its collection of decorators that can be applied to
your functions to instruct Numba to compile them.

When a call is made to a function using the `@jit` decorator from Numba, it is
compiled to machine code “just-in-time” for execution, and part or all of your
code can subsequently run at native machine code speed! Numba reads the Python
bytecode for a decorated function and combines this with information about the
types of the input arguments to the function. It analyzes and optimizes your
code, and finally uses the [LLVM compiler infrastructure](https://llvm.org/) to
generate a machine code version of your function, tailored to your CPU
capabilities. This compiled version is then used when your function is called.

The Numba `@jit` decorator fundamentally operates in two compilation modes,
`nopython` mode and `object` mode. The behaviour of the `nopython` compilation
mode is to essentially compile the decorated function so that it will run
entirely without the involvement of the Python interpreter. This is the
recommended and best-practice way to use the Numba `@jit` decorator as it leads to
the best performance. It is important to note that `nopython` mode is not
guaranteed to compile successfully. This can happen if there are unsupported
functions or classes which are used in the scope of the `@jit` decorator.

## Increasing support for NumPy functions in Numba

One of the current priorities of Numba is having seamless integration with
NumPy. As an intern at Quansight Labs, my main task was extending the list of
NumPy functions that are supported by Numba. Since Numba does not understand
calls to NumPy functions, developers have to reimplement such functions. The
easiest way to do so is using the `@numba.extending.overload` decorator, which
lets the developer write a new implementation of the function in Python. The new
implementation needs to have the same behaviour as the original function, but it
should also be completely supported by Numba; e.g., it cannot call NumPy
functions which are not supported yet. Most importantly, its return type should
depend only on the input types and never on the particular values of the inputs.

Numba developers keep track of unsupported NumPy functions in
[issue #4074](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/4074). My first task was
simple: pick a function from the list and implement it. I started by searching
the list for functions that have already been implemented or ones that have been
deprecated by NumPy. Then, I decided to pick the function `numpy.geomspace`,
since a very similar function, `numpy.logspace`, had been implemented already,
and this was a great starting point for me. This helped me introduce myself to
the Numba development workflow and the repository structure.

After my first pull request was merged, I moved on to other functions from the
list. Other NumPy functions for which I added support as a Quansight Labs intern
include `numpy.vsplit`, `numpy.hsplit`, `numpy.dsplit`, `numpy.rowstack`,
`numpy.diagflat`, `numpy.resize`, `numpy.indices` and `numpy.unwrap`. A great
guide to using the `@overload` decorator is given in the
[Numba documentation](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending/overloading-guide.html#a-guide-to-using-overload).

## The NumPy polynomial API

When choosing functions to implement, I was always looking for groups of similar
functions. That way, I could get more functions checked off of the list more
quickly. This led me to implementing `polyadd`, `polysub`, and `polymul` from
`numpy.polynomial.polynomial` simultaneously.

After seeing this, my mentor asked
me if I would like to focus on support for the NumPy polynomial package. I
agreed, since I felt like this would be a good way of working with lower levels
of Numba. In addition to adding other functions from the polynomial API, the
biggest task during my internship was implementing the `Polynomial` class. It is
fairly simple as it has three parameters - `coef`, `domain`, and `window`, each
of which is a NumPy array. This meant that the foundation of the implementation
was fairly straightforward. Unfortunately, there were a lot of details in the
behaviour of the class, and each small detail seemed challenging when I had to
implement it using the low-level API. The most interesting thing about the
implementation of the class is that the two optional parameters, `domain` and
`window`, have default values that are NumPy arrays of integer dtype, whereas if
the user decides to set `domain` and `window`, then these arrays are always cast
to arrays of double dtype. This meant that the user could never set the values
of these two parameters to their default values. I have opened
[pull request #24745](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24745) in NumPy that
aims to improve this behaviour for all classes in the `numpy.polynomial`
package.

## Adding support for power series in Numba

Similarly to functions, NumPy classes have to be reimplemented in Numba using
its low-level API. A good example of this can be found in the
[Numba documentation](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending/interval-example.html#example-an-interval-type),
which I followed very closely. The first big task when working on the
`Polynomial` class was defining a new Numba type to represent the class. After
creating a type class called `PolynomialType`, I needed to "show" Numba that
each instance of the `Polynomial` class should be treated by Numba as if its
type is `PolynomialType`, using the
`@typeof_impl.register` decorator with `np.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial` as its argument . Another
important part is defining the constructor for the `Polynomial` class. We decided
to add support for `Polynomial(coef)` and `Polynomial(coef, domain, window)` at
this point. The next step is to define a data model for the new type. That is,
how the `Polynomial` type will be represented in LLVM IR.

The final task when adding support for a new type in Numba is defining special
methods for converting Python objects into native values and vice versa. Those
operations are called boxing and unboxing. The idea here is that a Python object
can be seen as a sophisticated box containing a simple native value which is
what the data model needs. The tricky part in my implementation of these two methods was
that I had to keep track of whether the `domain` and `window` were defined by
the user or they were equal to their default values. This part is necessary since the
default values of those two parameters can never be set using the constructor,
as mentioned above.

## Further work on support for NumPy polynomials

Even after my pull requests were merged, there is still a lot of room for further work. For example,
NumPy supports five more types of polynomials: Chebyshev series, two types of
Hermite series, Laguerre, and Legendre. All of those have the same class
structure as the power series, but the behaviour of their methods is different.
These differences reflect the different kinds of operations that are being done on them:
e.g., the coefficients array of a product of two Chebyshev series is not the same
as if we were to multiply Legendre series.
