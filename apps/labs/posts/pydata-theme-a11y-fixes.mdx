# PyData Theme Accessibility Fixes, Before and After

Over the past several months, I have been working with a few coworkers and the
PyData community at large to make some accessibility improvements to the PyData
Sphinx Theme. For this blog post, I chose three such improvements (out of many!)
to examine with a before-and-after lens to give a better idea of how these kinds
of changes can create an improved user experience for disabled people—and often
for people without disabilities, too.

For those not familiar with Sphinx, it is a framework for writing documentation.
It is used, for example, to generate the official Python docs. As with many such
content generation frameworks, Sphinx supports customization via themes. One
such theme, created by and for the PyData community, is the PyData
Theme.

For those not familiar with accessibility, it is the practice of adapting built
environments (including digital and virtual environments) to meet the needs of
disabled people.

A small, subtle point of clarification before we begin. Throughout this blog
post, I will use screenshots from the [PyData Sphinx Theme
docs](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which
uses the theme; however, I want to emphasize that these improvements apply to
the theme itself, and by extension to all documentation sites that choose to use
it.

## Landmarks, Before and After

This section assumes that you know [what a screen reader
is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader).

If you are sighted, then when you visit a website, you are used to seeing the
content arranged in a limited number of ways: typically, a header, a main area,
a footer, maybe a sidebar. Visual cues like alignment, horizontal lines, and
font sizes all work together to help your eyes and brain to scan the page to
know where to look. But if you are blind, you rely on landmarks to fulfill the
same function. HTML5 provides tags like header, footer, and main that allow
web page authors to break up the content on the page into meaningful sections.
These sections can then be surfaced to screen readers and other assistive tech.

Screen reader software provides a way to quickly cycle through all of the
landmarks on the page. The following screenshot shows the landmarks as they
appeared in the macOS VoiceOver rotor before we fixed them. Imagine trying to
make sense of a website if you cycled through its landmarks and heard the
following:

> navigation, navigation, Section Navigation navigation, main, Breadcrumbs
> navigation, Breadcrumb navigation, main, navigation, footer

Confusing, right?

![](/posts/pydata-theme-a11y-fixes/landmarks-before.png)

In order to be useful, the set of landmarks needs to be short and unambiguous.
There should be one and only one landmark for the main part of the page, just as
there should only be one header and one footer. It’s okay to have multiple
navigations, but they should be clear and distinct from each other.

The next screenshot shows the same view with the landmarks fixed. If you read
the following aloud, can you now make sense of the page?

> Announcement complementary, banner, navigation, Section Navigation navigation,
> main, Breadcrumb navigation, article, On this page navigation, footer

Still a little bit of cleanup to be done, but much better, right?

![](/posts/pydata-theme-a11y-fixes/landmarks-after.png)

If you’re curious about how we did this, you can check out my [landmarks pull
request](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/1454) on GitHub.
Here’s also a short list summarizing what I did:

- Since the theme already had a `<main>` tag, I removed the `role="main"`
  attribute from the `<article>` tag
- Wrapped the header in a `<header>` tag (landmark = "banner")
- Got rid of nested `<nav>`s
- Put the announcement banner in an `<aside>` tag (landmark = "complementary")
- Used `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` attributes to label some of the
  landmarks (for example, to disambiguate one navigation from another)

Community feedback was key. I did not realize when I removed the `role="main"`
attribute that [Sphinx uses the corresponding
[role="main"]](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/4fbd3682d5cdf606159630f7daf6f818d58de05e/sphinx/themes/basic/static/searchtools.js#L185)
CSS attribute selector to highlight search results when a reader searches a
Sphinx-generated docs site. But one of our user-contributors, [Michael Wisely][(https://github.com/michael-wisely-gravwell),
[reported the missing search
highlight](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues/1676) on GitHub.
Then maintainer [Daniel McCloy](https://github.com/drammock) connected the dots. The fix was fortunately
straightforward. It just required redundantly adding the role attribute to the
main tag, like so: `<main role="main">`. (But don't do that in your own
day-to-day HTML! You can and should just use the `<main>` tag without the role
attribute.)

If you're curious about how I generated the screenshots in the pull request that
I linked, or if you're curious about how your own website looks in terms of
landmarks, you can download a browser extension like
[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) or [Accessibility
Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/downloads/). These extensions provide
a way to view all of the landmarks on a web page at once.

## Sidebar Table of Contents, Before and After

This section assumes some knowledge of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

A crucial part of web accessibility is keyboard accessibility. This means that
users should be able to use your website without a mouse or touch device—in
other words, with only a keyboard. Not only does this help low-vision users;
providing full keyboard access is like providing a kind of input API to your
site. Different kinds of assistive tech can hook into the same interface
intended for keyboards. (There is a nice historical continuity here as some of
the first [typewriters were assistive
tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansen_Writing_Ball).)

The PyData theme provides a table of contents in the left sidebar. One nice
feature of this table of contents is that site authors can choose how many
nested levels to show before the sublevels are hidden automatically beneath an
expand/collapse button. The only problem with this expand/collapse "button",
though, was that it was not keyboard accessible.

![A "before" screenshot shows a mouse pointer hovering over a toggle "button" to
convey the idea that prior to the accessibility work, the "button" was only
point-and-click accessible, not
keyboard accessible](/posts/pydata-theme-a11y-fixes/sidebar-toc-before.png)

I put "button" in quotes because a true HTML `<button>` is keyboard accessible,
meaning that a user can both navigate to it using only the keyboard (via the
`Tab` key) **and** a user can "press" the button using only the keyboard (via
`Space`, `Enter` or `Return` keys). But in the case of our foldable/unfoldable
table of contents, it had been implemented without HTML buttons to avoid
JavaScript. It used two tricks in a clever way:

1. In HTML, if you associate a `<label>` with an `<input type="checkbox" />`,
   then clicking the label checks and unchecks the associated checkbox.
2. In CSS, you can select a checked checkbox using the `:checked`
   pseudo-selector.

You can then use CSS to always hide the checkbox and to selectively fold or
unfold the next level in the table of contents based on whether the checkbox is
checked. In code, it looks like the following:

```html
<li>
  <!-- table of contents entry --!>
  <a href="kitchen-sink">Kitchen Sink</a>

  <!-- checkbox hidden via CSS -->
  <input id="toc-checkbox-1" class="toc-checkbox" type="checkbox" />

  <!-- label associated with checkbox -->
  <label for="toc-checkbox-1">🔽</label>

  <!-- next level of TOC -->
  <ul>
    <!-- ... -->
  </ul>
</li>
```

```css
/* Always hide the checkbox */
.toc-checkbox {
  display: none;
}

/* When checkbox is not checked, hide the next level of the table of contents */
.toc-checkbox ~ ul {
  display: none;
}

/* When checkbox is checked, unhide the next level of the table of contents */
.toc-checkbox:checked ~ ul {
  display: block;
}
```

The `~` is standard CSS, but it's not very commonly used. It's called the
subsequent-sibling combinator. `A ~ B` means select all B elements that come
after A and are at the same level in the HTML tree (A and B share the same
parent). In other words, B must be a "younger sibling" of A.

The problem with this clever, CSS-only technique is that browsers do not treat
the label as a keyboard-interactive element; they only provide keyboard
interactivity for its associated checkbox. But the checkbox has been made
invisible, leaving only the label behind, so there's no way to interact with the
checkbox using only a keyboard. Interestingly, even though the checkbox is
hidden, browsers will still transmit clicks from the label to the checkbox, so
that when you click or press the label, it causes the associated, invisible
checkbox to be checked and unchecked. But, to reiterate, the browser provides
the label itself with no keyboard interactivity.

I should mention that I do not know if every browser behaves this way. But I am
sure that this was the behavior in Chrome when I was working on this. It's also
worth mentioning that screen readers, such as macOS VoiceOver and NVDA, will
generally provide keyboard interactivity for the label element in the absence of
the browser providing it, but it's also worth mentioning that to meet the [Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines success criterion
2.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html), this sort of
functionality should be operable by the keyboard in general and not just in the
particular circumstance of having a screen reader.

So what if you turn the label into a tab stop like so: `<label tabindex="0">`,
what do you think happens?

Well, it allows you to reach the element via keyboard, but you still cannot
interact with it by pressing `Enter` or any other key. You cannot check or
uncheck the hidden checkbox this way. So there's no way to make the label
element keyboard-accessible without actually wiring it up with JavaScript to a
keyboard event handler, at which point you might as well just use a button and a
click handler.

This meant that I needed to rethink the way that the table of contents was
implemented.

Some of the ideas that my team came up with:

- Use the [disclosure widget
  pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/).
- Use a button plus JavaScript
- Use the [tree view
  pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/)

Since I was a little unsure about which direction to take, I decided to ask an
expert. Here I would like to a give a big shout out to [Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.design/). Some time
ago I had read on his blog that he was offering office hours as a way to
give back to the community. So I sent him an email to ask him if he was still
offering. He replied yes and asked me for more info about the problem I was
working on, then we scheduled a Zoom call.

One thing I wanted to find out from Eric was whether we should use the ARIA tree
role. The conclusion of that conversation for me was that an ARIA role is like a
user experience contract, and unless you plan to follow the contract exactly,
it's best not to use it. For example, the tree view pattern comes with the
expectation that you can expand a node in the tree using the right arrow key and
collapse the same node using the left arrow key, so unless you plan to implement
those keyboard shortcuts with your own JavaScript code, then you shouldn't use
the associated ARIA role.

After the very helpful discussion with Eric Bailey, I decided I would use the
disclosure pattern. This made sense to me for two reasons:

1. The pattern fits the needed UX for a foldable table of contents very well since
   its purpose is to hide and unhide content.
2. It does not require JavaScript and it is available in all modern browsers,
   which increases the chances that it will work well across a broad range of
   devices and assistive technologies.

From there, it was _almost_ a straightforward implementation. 😆

Can you guess what problem I ran into from the following HTML?

```html
<li>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <a href="topics">Topic guides</a>
      <span role="presentation" class="toggle-icon" />
    </summary>
    <ul>
      <!-- next level of toc -->
    </ul>
  </details>
</li>
```

[TODO: create a Codepen to illustrate this?]

The issue is that browsers consider everything in the summary tag to be
clickable content that, when clicked, shows or hides the details. But for our
table of contents, the section headings are also pages that we need to link to.
This makes the click ambiguous. Does the user want to navigate to the opening
page of that section or expand the table of contents at that section? It also
created an ambiguity for keyboard interactivity. With the markup above, when the
user pressed the tab key, the entire section heading plus the expand/collapse
icon is selected (as shown in the following screenshot). The user has to press the
tab key a second time to focus on just the link. So again, it's unclear whether
pressing the `Enter` key should follow the link or expand the section.

![](/posts/pydata-theme-a11y-fixes/ambiguous-summary.png)

With the help of my designer partner in crime, [Smera Goel](https://github.com/smeragoel), we decided that we
should present the two elements, the link and the expand/collapse icon, as
completely separate. This led to a new, slightly different markup structure,
which allows the toggle button to be focussed separately from the section link:

```html
<li>
  <a href="topics">Topic guides</a>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <span role="presentation" class="toggle-icon" />
    </summary>
    <ul>
      <!-- next level of toc -->
    </ul>
  </details>
</li>
```

[TODO: create a Codepen to illustrate this?]

| Focus on section title / link                                                | Focus on toggle icon                                                           |

The thing I don't love about this is that it is a somewhat unconventional
implementation and presentation of a details/summary widget. And let's recall
that it was an unconventional use of a standard pattern (label + checkbox) that
got us into this mess to begin with. That said, I think this particular
unconventional presentation is okay. I think it may come across as somewhat
confusing to screen reader users the first time they come across it, but I also
think the context will quickly make things clear.

At the very least, we know that we have enabled keyboard interaction in the
sidebar table of contents where there was none before, and that in itself is a
good step forward for accessibility. There's probably room for improvement, as
always, which is why we are [always eager for community
feedback](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/discussions).

Another improvement we made is that prior to this work the toggle button did not
communicate its state (open or closed) to the [accessibility
tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree). By
using the HTML native disclosure widget (i.e., `<details>` and `<summary>`),
this information gets conveyed automatically to the accessibility tree, no
JavaScript needed.

For reference, here is a link to the pull request for this work: [Make TOC
sections expandable and collapsible by
keyboard](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/1582).

## Focus Indicators, Before and After

Now that we've had an in-depth look at keyboard accessibility, let's continue on
this theme and examine an important aspect: focus indicators. When users
navigate a web page by pressing the tab key, they need to know where they are on
the page. If they are using a screen reader, it will read out the content at the
currently focussed element. But users not using a screen reader need to be able
to see some kind of visual indicator of where the focus is. Imagine trying to
use a mouse without a cursor. That's what it's like to use a keyboard without
focus indicators. By default, browsers use a focus ring to show focus. This is
what the default focus ring in Chrome looks like:

| Button not focussed (no focus ring)                   | Button focussed (default browser focus ring)                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](/posts/pydata-theme-a11y-fixes/chrome-button.png) | ![](/posts/pydata-theme-a11y-fixes/chrome-button-focus-ring.png) |

Improving and ensuring focus indicators across all interactive elements in the
PyData theme was a major part of the accessibility work we did in the past six
months. There were lots of places where focus rings were missing, incomplete,
low contrast, or just didn't look good. In this section, I've rounded up and
grouped several examples to show-and-tell the before-and-after difference.

### Missing focus rings

The most important kind of before-and-after fix that we made was to add focus
rings to places where they were missing. Now, you might wonder why there were
missing focus rings to begin with, since the browser provides them by default. TODO:
Ask Chris Holdgraff if he knows about Sphinx-copybutton and Sphinx-togglebutton
(he added the `outline: none` rule). My best guess is that the focus rings were
removed to fix some other issue and were never restored because their importance was
not appreciated. So it bears repeating here: in your own CSS, be very careful
about setting `outline: none` on any keyboard-focusable element because that
will turn off the browser's default focus ring.

I don't have a full inventory of all the places [missing focus
indicators](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/1549), but there
were at least seven. Here are before and after screenshots of two such places:

![focus ring on code block copy button](/posts/pydata-theme-a11y-fixes/focus-ring-copy-button-after.png)
![focus ring on dropdown admonitions](/posts/pydata-theme-a11y-fixes/focus-ring-toggle-admonition-after.png)

### Inaccessible or broken focus rings

In some places where there were focus rings they were broken or did not meet
accessibility guidelines. Here are two examples. In one, the focus ring doesn't
have sufficient contrast with the background. In the other, there is a bug with
the focus ring. It is squished and does not contain the focussed element.

| Gallery tile                                                                                                                             | In-page table of contents                                                                                                  |

### Frankenstates

My colleague Smera Goel, while working through the focus ring designs, coined a
term that I find helpful when talking about the challenge of harmonizing several
different kinds of indicators on the same element. For example, a link can have
a hover state, a focus state, a visited state, a non-visited state, an active
state (when you are actively clicking it), and a current state (if you're on the
page that the link goes to). Many of these states can overlap, hence
"frankenstates." For example, a link can be hovered and focussed at the same
time by using the mouse and keyboard together. It's a challenge to design for
all of these states in such a way that all the different frankenstates look
good. It's even more of a challenge if your design process is access-centered.
In many design systems, a lot of state differences are conveyed through color
alone. A previously visited link might be purple, an unvisited link blue, an
active link green. But an access-centered designer is wary of relying on color
alone (because of various forms of color blindness and vision impairments). But
that removes an entire dimension from the design space, and you end up designing
for the frakenstates in much the same way that you would arrange a tiny
apartment: carefully, thoughtfully, creatively, skillfully, and with a
willingness to make needed compromises.

| Header nav link: hover + focus + current                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Polish

There were also a lot of places that needed polish. The main idea here for me is
that in my accessibility work my goal is not to just get things to work, but to
work well and look good.

There isn't a single GitHub pull request that I can point to in which all of
these focus ring issues were fixed. They were done over many weeks and PRs,
including but not limited to:
[#1415](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/1415),
[#1555](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/1555),

This blog post is not meant to capture all of the accessibility work that we did
over the past six months, but rather my hope is that I have given you a taste of
what this work looks like from the developer side of things.

If you would like to take a more exhaustive look, your best option would be to
look at all of the [PST issues and PRs tagged with
accessibility](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues?q=label%3A%22tag%3A+accessibility%22).
If you find anything you would like to see written about in a blog post like
this one, please let us know!

## Accessibility in this Blog Post

If you write online content, part of your accessibility story will likely be in
what's provided by the authoring tools you choose (like PyData Sphinx Theme),
but some part of it is going to be more directly in your hands, in how you
present and structure your content. There are a number of things that I did in
writing this blog post to make it more accessible, for example:

- All of the images have alt text or are described by the surrounding text. Even
  if you cannot see the screenshots in this blog post, you still get the
  pertinent information because I do not rely on the images alone to tell the
  story. I try to make sure that all relevant visual information is conveyed
  through text. There is a real art to this, just as there is with writing, so
  it's always a learning-and-improving process.
- All of the links in the blog post are **descriptive**. If you take a link out
  of the context of the blog post, it should still give you a good clue about
  where it will take you.
- The headings are clear and in the right order, with only one level-1 heading
  (`<h1>`) for the blog post title

I hope that this blog post has given you an inside look at some of the
accessibility work we do here at Quansight Labs, and that you can hopefully
apply some of the lessons we have learned. 🌻
