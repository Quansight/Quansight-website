Making community-driven open source projects thrive is at the core of what we do
at Quansight. We are therefore extremely pleased to announce that, for the
second year in a row, we have been able to support several open source projects
and their maintainers through our OSS Fund, a program designed to provide
direct, unrestricted financial support to critical open-source dependencies.

## The 2025 recipients

The four recipients of this year's Quansight OSS Fund are:

- [coverage.py](https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy) ($6,000).
  _Code coverage measurement for Python. Coverage.py measures code coverage,
  typically during test execution. It uses the code analysis tools and tracing
  hooks provided in the Python standard library to determine which lines are
  executable, and which have been executed._
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) ($6,000).
  _Sphinx makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation._
- [pkgconf](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf) ($3,500).
  _`pkgconf` is a program which helps to configure compiler and linker flags for
  development libraries. It is a superset of the functionality provided by
  pkg-config from freedesktop.org, but does not provide bug-compatibility with
  the original pkg-config._
- [LIEF](https://lief.re/) ($3,500).
  _Library to Instrument Executable Formats (LIEF) aims at providing a cross
  platform library to parse, modify and abstract ELF, PE and MachO formats._

We deeply appreciate these projects and their maintainers, and hope that our
donations help keep these projects healthy and their maintainers engaged and
able to achieve their goals for the project.

## Building sustaining OSS into our business model

The amount we've donated this year amounts to roughly 0.6% of our revenue. We've
built accumulating funds to distribute each year directly into our operating
model, and we consider it an important part of how we operate as a Public
Benefit Company. Most of our own work is done inside open source communities,
and one of the things we've realized for a long time is that that work tends to
put a small but non-negligible extra burden on the upstream dependencies of
projects we work on. This year's recipients are exactly such dependencies - two
widely used tools in the Python ecosystem, and two libraries/tools that are
language-independent.

Last year, we launched our first OSS Fund as an experiment. The positive
feedback from our team, the recipients, and the broader community confirmed its
value. We have therefore decided to make the fund a permanent pillar of how we
run Quansight, as a valuable addition to other forms of sponsorships (e.g., for
nonprofits and conferences) and to building bridges with more maintainers to
jointly apply for funding or collaborate on existing funded projects.

## Funds usage

The funds are unrestricted, which we know from personal experience can be quite
valuable. Unlike grants, consulting contracts, and most other sources of income,
the money can be spent on any purpose and without needing to be spent on a
timeline. We are delighted to see recipients share how they plan to use the
funds of course. Romain Thomas, LIEF maintainer, shared:

> I plan to use this funding to improve our internal CI by adding a new
> Windows ARM64 runner and an additional Linux runner.

And Ned Batchelder, coverage.py maintainer, writes on his sponsorship profile:

> I do a few different things in the Python world: I maintain a few software
> projects, notably coverage.py, the Python coverage testing tool. [...]
> Sponsorship money will enable and encourage me to keep doing all those
> things.

## How we select recipients

We use a two-stage selection process, with all of Quansight's employees and
interns able to nominate OSS projects, and then participate in a voting round.
The criteria for eligibility of an OSS project were:

- The project must have an OSI-approved open source license,
- A Quansight employee cannot own or maintain the project,
- This cannot be a project for which Quansight already has an active grant or
  funding source (directly or indirectly as a contractor or sub-awardee in a
  grant or have an ongoing CWO with Quansight),
- The project has little to no significant structural income (relative to its
  size), i.e. it is mostly or entirely volunteer-driven,
- It is acceptable to nominate projects with one single maintainer,
- The project aligns with Quansight’ mission and values and/or is an upstream
  dependency of projects we support and sustain,
- The project is actively maintained,
- Depending on the project’s size and maturity, the project should have a Code
  of Conduct.

We made a small change compared to last year in those criteria. We found that
quite a few well-known single-maintainer projects that someone wanted to
nominate had no Code of Conduct (CoC), while larger projects almost always did
have a CoC. Single-maintainer projects that are critical dependencies for larger
projects or a whole ecosystem are quite important (xref [this XKCD
comic](https://xkcd.com/2347/)) and we wanted to make sure they weren't excluded
from consideration - hence we loosened our "must have a CoC" requirement a
little.

## Inspired to Contribute?

We hope this initiative inspires other companies who benefit from open source to
consider how they can contribute back to the ecosystem's sustainability. To
learn more about Quansight's work sustaining open source, please read our
[Annual Report](https://labs.quansight.org/annual-reports/quansight-labs-annual-report-2024.pdf)
or [reach out about our services](https://quansight.com/consulting/). If you're
a maintainer of a critical OSS project, we encourage you to reach out to us if
you see opportunities to collaborate, and keep doing the amazing work you do!
