We recently had the great pleasure of welcoming our second cohort of interns at Labs! The goal of our internship program is to provide them the opportunity to connect with open source communities and leaders, and grow professionally while developing solutions for the larger scientific open source ecosystem. Without further ado, allow us to introduce this wonderful new team and their projects!

[Asmi Jafar](https://www.github.com/asmijafar20), based in Aligarh, India, is a final year student of masters in Computer Applications at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). Asmi is profoundly influenced by technology and the various ways it can be used to express art. She is interested in contributing to open source projects to gain skills, and learning new things. Asmi has previously contributed to a variety of projects in the Moja Global community while completing her Outreachy internship. In her spare time, she loves to read good books, paint, and dance. Here's a quote she chose to share from one of her favorite works, The Last Lecture, by Jeffrey Zaslow and Randy Pausch:
> The Brick walls are there for a reason, they are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something.
Asmi is mentored by [Amit Kumar](https://github.com/aktech), [Eskild Eriksen](https://github.com/iameskild), and [Vinicius D. Cerutti](https://github.com/viniciusdc) as she contributes to [nebari](https://www.nebari.dev/).

[Dennis Chukwunta](http://www.github.com/th3nn3ss), based in Imo State, Nigeria, is a computer science student at Imo state university, in his final year of studies. Dennis enjoys reading and playing old video games, and he secretly wishes he could solve all the world's problems with a computer. At Labs, Dennis is working on standardization improvements in [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) with his mentors [Aaron Meurer](https://github.com/asmeurer) and [Noa Tamir](https://github.com/noatamir).

[Kulsoom Zahra](https://github.com/kulsoomzahra), based in India, is a graduate with a CS major. She is constantly exploring and trying out new stuff, and is particularly fond of adventure sports! Her digital interests are in privacy and security. Kulsoom was fortunate to contribute to defending online privacy during her Outreachy internship at The Tor Project. She is mentored by [Gabriel Fouasnon](https://github.com/gabalafou) as she contributes to removing accessibility barriers in [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

[Pranav Goel](https://github.com/iipranavii), based in New Delhi, India, is a UX designer, who loves colors, working on mobile and web designs, and of course open source. He has a background in computer software engineering and when he isn’t busy reading documentation he loves reading thrillers and murder mysteries. Pranav will be working on Accessibility in Data Visualization during his internship at Quansight Labs with his mentors [Isabela Presedo-Floyd](https://github.com/isabela-pf) and [Tania Allard](https://github.com/trallard).

[Sangho Lee](https://github.com/puhuk), based in Seoul, South Korea, researches computer vision at graduate school and has contributed to open source projects like PyTorch/vision. He is excited to join Quansight and the [PyTorch-Ignite](https://pytorch.org/ignite/index.html) project, working alongside his mentor [Victor Fomin](https://github.com/vfdev-5).

[Surbhi Sharma](https://github.com/ssurbhi560), based in India, completed her B.Sc.(Hons) in computer application last year (July 2021). After which, she began working at the Pravartak Technologies lab as a Project Associate. Surbhi has been a part of the MLH Fellowship (Open Source Track) with GitLab and is currently working as an Outreachy Intern at conda-forge. She likes to code in Python, build projects related to web development, and contribute to open source projects. Surbhi will be mentored by [Jaime Rodríguez-Guerra](https://github.com/jaimergp) and [Gonzalo Peña-Castellanos](https://github.com/goanpeca), as she contributes to community-driven innovation in the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) ecosystem.

A warm welcome to Quansight Labs! We are excited to see your projects develop over the next 3 months, and look forward to working with you all. Thank you for joining us, and special thanks to [Melissa Weber Mendonça](https://github.com/melissawm) for organizing this program and bringing us all together.
