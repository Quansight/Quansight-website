**At [Quansight][quansight site], we’ve been hosting a series of live streams
that feature our talented open source developers talking about the software they
contribute to and the communities around them. During a recent quirkshop our
incredible JupyterLab developers got together to discuss the upcoming major
version changes to [JupyterLab][jupyterlab docs]. We discussed the toil that
core developers are investing to improve the experience of JupyterLab not only
for developers but for users as well.**

See the [video of this quirkshop][quirkshop video].

The extension system is a central concept to JupyterLab; all of the features
(e.g., notebook editor, file browser, menus, and status bar elements) are
extensions that interface into the greater JupyterLab ecosystem. The core
extensions that ship with JupyterLab that establish the baseline JupyterLab
interface. Third-party community extensions can then be installed to enhance and
augment the user experience. This model allows for development to happen inside
the tool itself, and co-development to happen by the surrounding ecosystem.

Very soon, JupyterLab will be achieving a major milestone by upgrading from
version 2 to 3. The next few sections will highlight the impacts of this upgrade
from individual and organizational perspectives.
