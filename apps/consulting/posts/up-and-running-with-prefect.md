series._

There are many types of computations that can be broken down into subtasks. Some
of these tasks may be resource-intensive or long-running, and may fail at any
time for multiple reasons. Being able to define tasks, chain them together, and
monitor execution is a nontrivial part of any modern computational pipeline.
However, most researchers, data scientists, and software engineers want to focus
on solving big-picture questions without worrying about these kinds of
bookkeeping details. In the past decade or so, several task management libraries
have attempted to make task tracking easy for the programmer, with [Apache
Airflow][airflow homepage] and [Luigi][luigi repo] being some of the most well
known. Here, we will focus on a recent addition, [Prefect][prefect repo].

## Prefect

Prefect is an open source workflow management library designed to make it simple
for users to keep track of task execution with only minimal changes to their
code. The first public release of Prefect, v0.2.0, was in July of 2018, with the
Prefect team releasing on a regular cadence ever since.
[prefect.io][prefect site], the company behind the Prefect library (also known
as [Prefect Core][prefect site: core] in the official documentation), offers a
cloud-based task management dashboard called
[Prefect Cloud][prefect site: cloud] as their flagship product. By itself, the
[Prefect library][prefect repo] is open source and totally free to use. Today
we'll explore some of Prefect's data structures by building a simple pipeline
from the ground up. Along the way, we'll show how to:

- Define the _tasks_ (read: functions) that will make up the pipeline
- Chain _tasks_ together into a _flow_ as a way of defining their
  interdependencies
- Run the _flow_ (or pipeline), and examine the output
- Visualize the _task_ graph with Graphviz

### Installing Prefect

First we'll need to install Prefect; we'll also need [pandas][pandas site] and
[NumPy][numpy site]. For example data, we'll make use of the [Palmer penguins
dataset][palmer penguins pypi] available on PyPI:

```bash
$ pip install prefect prefect[viz] pandas NumPy palmerpenguins
```

`prefect[viz]` is an optional extra which is only needed if you want to generate
flow visualizations with Graphviz.

## The Example: How Much Does It Cost to Ship All of the Palmer Penguins🐧?

The Palmer penguins dataset is a great example dataset first published in 2014
by [Gorman, Williams, and Fraser][gorman williams fraser paper] and originally
collected into an R package by [Allison Horst][allison horst paper]. Here, we'll
use this dataset to calculate the cost of shipping all the penguins on three
antarctic islands via the postal service (after all, they can't fly on their own
😢). The penguins need to be classified according to whether they are shippable
as-is, or oversize (and therefore subject to a higher fee). Finally, we need to
calculate the total cost of shipping the entire bird population. We'll start by
importing the required libraries and getting the dataset.

```python
>>> import prefect, pandas, numpy, palmerpenguins
>>> penguins = palmerpenguins.load_penguins()
>>> penguins
```

### Defining Tasks

With Prefect, the smallest components of a pipeline are called _tasks_. These
are individual operations which are usually strung together to carry out loading
of data, transformations, and output. Prefect's functional API makes it simple
to turn Python functions into _tasks_ using decorators. Here we'll define
`clean_data`, which removes any rows which contain a NaN (not a number) value:

```python
@prefect.task
def clean_data(df) -> pandas.DataFrame:
    return df.dropna()
```

Note that we're using type annotations on the return values here because Prefect
uses the annotations to handle _tasks_ which return multiple arguments.

`split_oversize` splits the penguins into two dataframes: one group of standard
sized birds and another for the oversize population.

```python
@prefect.task
def split_oversize(df, oversize_mass = 5000) -> tuple[pandas.DataFrame, pandas.DataFrame]:
    oversize = df['body_mass_g'] < oversize_mass
    return df.loc[~oversize], df.loc[oversize]
```

`compute_costs` computes the shipping cost of a group of penguins based on their
mass. Oversize parcels cost 0.022, while standard parcels cost 0.014.

```python
@prefect.task
def compute_costs(df, is_oversize) -> pandas.DataFrame:
    df = df.copy()
    price_per_g = is_oversize and 0.022 or 0.014

    df['cost'] = df['body_mass_g'] * price_per_g
    return df
```

`compute_total_cost` adds the cost of shipping the standard as well as the
oversize penguins to get the total cost for shipping the entire population.

```python
@prefect.task
def compute_total_cost(standard, oversize) -> float:
    return standard['cost'].sum() + oversize['cost'].sum()
```

### Running the Tasks

Here, we've defined Python functions as usual for removing bad data, for
splitting the penguins into dataframes containing standard birds and oversize
birds, and for computing the cost of the shipments. The only additional code
needed to enable monitoring for these _tasks_ is the `@prefect.task` decorator
above each function; this decorator turns each function into a `prefect.Task`
class instance. In a moment we'll assemble these _tasks_ into a complete
pipeline, but if you still want to execute one of these functions independently
of the others, you'll need to call the `.run()` method:

```python
>>> clean_data.run(penguins)
```

|     | species | island    | bill_length_mm | bill_depth_mm | flipper_length_mm | body_mass_g | sex    | year |
| --- | ------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------ | ---- |
| 0   | Adelie  | Torgersen | 39.1           | 18.7          | 181.0             | 3750.0      | male   | 2007 |
| 1   | Adelie  | Torgersen | 39.5           | 17.4          | 186.0             | 3800.0      | female | 2007 |
| 2   | Adelie  | Torgersen | 40.3           | 18.0          | 195.0             | 3250.0      | female | 2007 |
| 4   | Adelie  | Torgersen | 36.7           | 19.3          | 193.0             | 3450.0      | female | 2007 |
| 5   | Adelie  | Torgersen | 39.3           | 20.6          | 190.0             | 3650.0      | male   | 2007 |
| 6   | Adelie  | Torgersen | 38.9           | 17.8          | 181.0             | 3625.0      | female | 2007 |
| 7   | Adelie  | Torgersen | 39.2           | 19.6          | 195.0             | 4675.0      | male   | 2007 |
| 12  | Adelie  | Torgersen | 41.1           | 17.6          | 182.0             | 3200.0      | female | 2007 |
| 13  | Adelie  | Torgersen | 38.6           | 21.2          | 191.0             | 3800.0      | male   | 2007 |
| 14  | Adelie  | Torgersen | 34.6           | 21.1          | 198.0             | 4400.0      | male   | 2007 |
| 15  | Adelie  | Torgersen | 36.6           | 17.8          | 185.0             | 3700.0      | female | 2007 |

&nbsp; &nbsp; _This table shows 16 out of 333 rows and 8 columns._

In order to execute these _tasks_ on our data we'll need to define the order in
which they need to be run; we'll do this by chaining them together into a
_flow_, which defines their order of execution.

1. We first need to remove the bad data, as some rows have NaN values
2. We then compute the cost of each shipment, with an additional fee added if it
   is an oversize penguin
3. Finally, we add the cost of all the shipments together to get the
   `total_cost` of shipping the entire population

Prefect allows us to easily define these dependencies with Python's
[context manager syntax][context manager syntax]:

```python
>>> with prefect.Flow('Shipment Flow') as flow:
...     penguins_cleaned = clean_data(penguins)
...     standard, oversize = split_oversize(penguins_cleaned)
...     standard_cost = compute_costs(standard, is_oversize=False)
...     oversize_cost = compute_costs(oversize, is_oversize=True)
...     total_cost = compute_total_cost(standard_cost, oversize_cost)
```

With the _flow_ defined, let's pause for just a moment. In a complicated
workflow, there might be _hundreds_ of individual _tasks_, each of which may
have numerous dependencies on the output of other _tasks_. How can we be sure
that the order in which we've instantiated the _tasks_ inside the _flow_ sets up
the dependencies as we intended?

One of the most useful features of Prefect is that it makes it easy to visualize
the relationships between the various _tasks_ using Graphviz:

```python
>>> flow.visualize()
```

<img
src="/posts/up-and-running-with-prefect/prefect-img-3.png"
width="450px"
/>

Here, each node of the graph represents a _task_, and each arrow indicates a
dependency. Visualizations such as these allow us to quickly confirm that our
mental model of the computation matches up with what we intended to program.
Brilliant! Okay, the _flow_ has been set up and we're sure the _task_ graph
looks good. Let's run it!

```none
>>> state = flow.run()

[2021-08-26 14:43:38-0700] INFO - prefect.FlowRunner | Beginning Flow run for 'Shipment Flow'

```

From the information that Prefect logs (to `stdout`, by default), it looks like
all of the _tasks_ executed successfully. Next, let's look at the results.

### Interpreting the Results

Prefect has a number of useful features related to storing, caching, and
retrieving results. By default, the `State` instance returned by `flow.run()`
stores the state of each _task_ in a dictionary:

```none
>>> task_results = state.result
>>> task_results

{<Task: clean_data>: <Success: "Task run succeeded.">,

<Task: split_oversize>: <Success: "Task run succeeded.">,

<Task: compute_costs>: <Success: "Task run succeeded.">,

<Task: split_oversize[0]>: <Success: "Task run succeeded.">,

<Task: split_oversize[1]>: <Success: "Task run succeeded.">,

<Task: compute_costs>: <Success: "Task run succeeded.">,

<Task: compute_total_cost>: <Success: "Task run succeeded.">}
```

The `Result` associated with each `Task` instance contains the output of the
decorated function:

```python
>>> task_results[total_cost].result

27896.1
```

This is the total cost of shipping the entire population of standard and
oversize penguins. Finally, we can visualize the state of the _flow_, this time
after the run:

```python
>>> flow.visualize(flow_state=state)
```

<img
src="/posts/up-and-running-with-prefect/prefect-img-4.png"
width="450px"
/>

Each node is now green, indicating that it executed successfully.

## Going Further With Prefect

We've demonstrated how Prefect can quickly and simply manage and track task
execution. Although this isn't the most complicated example, it succinctly
illustrates some of the core features of Prefect, and could be readily modified
to tackle more difficult problems. While [prefect.io][prefect site] certainly
targets machine learning pipelines with its branding and documentation, Prefect
could be useful for anything where _task_ tracking is important—including
research applications.

If you'd like to learn more about Prefect's powerful
