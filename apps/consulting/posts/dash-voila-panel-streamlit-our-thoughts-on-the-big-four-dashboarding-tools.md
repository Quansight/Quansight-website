At Quansight, we use the top four Python dashboarding tools and clients often
ask which one we recommend. Here’s our breakdown of each and why you might
choose one over another.

## The Power of Interactive Data Visualization

TLDR: There are many great interactive dashboarding options in Python, which
should you use? Jump to the <a href="#which-one-should-i-use"
target="_self">comparison</a> for our thoughts.

It's often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and similarly so is a
well-crafted data visualization. It conveys a complex message quickly and
effectively. There are examples throughout history of people telling a
[visual story][influential data visualizations] of what is happening in their
datasets.

One of the most famous examples is from French civil engineer, Charles Minard.
In 1869, Minard created this precursor to the modern
[Sankey diagram][sankey diagram @ wik] that shows the dwindling size of
Napoleon’s army as it advanced through Russia during the Russian campaign of
1812-1813. Minard captured five different variables in his map—direction,
distance, size, location, and temperature.

![Diagram showing the advance toward and retreat from Moscow by Napoleon's army during the Russian campaign of 1812-1813, from the Neman River east to Moscow. The advance is shown as a painted tan line, and the retreat with a painted black line. The size of the army at each point is shown by the thickness of the painted line. Two instances where the army was split are shown by branches in the painted line. The line thickness is reduced by nearly 75% by the time it reaches Moscow, and is reduced by more than an order of magnitude by the time the retreat returns to the Neman River](/posts/dash-voila-panel-streamlit-our-thoughts-on-the-big-four-dashboarding-tools/big-four-img-1.png)

While data visualizations like these are great at conveying meaning for an
established dataset, where they fall short is in providing a path to
understanding during exploratory analysis of new and complex data. This is where
interactive visualization dashboards come into play. By providing an interface
to interact with the data and seeing how changes in key parameters affect
various outcomes, these tools provide users a way to gain deeper insights into
what the data is telling them.

The New York Times is an example of an organization that has elevated the
ability of the public to understand the data underlying complex issues through
the [amazing interactive visualizations][nyt visualizations overview] that they
publish regularly.
“[Olympic Races, in Your Neighborhood][olympic races in your neighborhood]” is a
great example of making data accessible, representing a race an Olympian ran,
and how quickly they ran it, in a way that you intuitively understand.

Today’s organizations are awash in data. In the last several years, there has
been an exponential explosion in data created and stored. Based on estimates
from [Statista][statista data creation estimate], we are on track to hit 180
zettabytes of global data creation by 2025 (a zettabyte has 21 zeros after the
one).

Understanding and gaining insights about data is now a critical need at any
organization and this has led to an explosion of tools and systems aimed at
storing, analyzing, and visualizing massive datasets. In this post, we will
explore some of the Python options for interactive visualization, but before
that, we need to address the question of why Python based tools are a contender
in this space.

## Why Use Python?

### Javascript vs Python vs BI Tools

There are many great visualization tools available to today’s data practitioner.
For the purposes of this discussion, we are going to address browser-based web
visualization tools. The web browser has become the world’s largest software
distribution platform and interactivity in the modern web is almost exclusively
provided via the Javascript engines present in web browsers. This means that
Javascript is at the core of nearly all interactive data visualizations
delivered over the web. There are three broad categories of how this is
practically achieved.

On one end, we have the Javascript visualization libraries. The advantage of
going this route is maximum control, customizability, and the ability to build
some truly unique data visualizations. The interactive New York Times’
dashboards we mentioned are great examples of this and are typically built using
Javascript visualization libraries like [d3.js][ds.js homepage] and similar.

This approach is powerful but requires access to a strong Javascript software
development team and close coordination between the data scientists and the
software developers. Javascript is not commonly used for complex data analytics
and has limited access to rich data analysis libraries and AI/ML tools. The
lingua franca of data scientists is Python, which means that collaboration is
required between the data science team and the Javascript developer team.
Translating requirements between teams is a slow and error-prone exercise,
typically with a big gap between the domain experts and the final visualizations
and messaging.

On the other end, we have business intelligence or BI Tools. These are
commercial platforms like Tableau and PowerBI. These tools are great if you have
tabular data or are pulling from a database and content with the prepackaged
visualization options. They give business analysts or data scientists with
little coding background the ability to set up rich and complex charts and
dashboards and easily publish them. On the downside, they have limited
capabilities for datasets that are non-tabular, and they have limited
extendability to custom visualizations, which can leave the domain experts
feeling limited in their ability to tell their data story.

Finally, the Python visualization tools lie in a happy middle ground. They
provide full access to the powerful data analytics/AI/ML tools available in
Python, but don’t require knowledge of web software development. Most engineers
and data scientists are already familiar with the level of Python coding
required to use these tools, and they can build complex data visualizations
easily.

Under the hood, these visualizations are converted to Javascript so they can be
deployed through websites. With full access to PyData analytics and big data
libraries, they are not limited to tabular data. They can analyze many forms of
data, as well as build experiences that let the user explore custom
algorithms/AI/ML features in an interactive manner.

By bringing the ability to build and publish data visualizations closer to the
domain experts, Python-based tools allow for a richer experience and for quick
dissemination of important information across an organization.

Javascript Tools -- Maximum customizability -- Requires communication between SMEs and Javascript dev team -- Challenging to do quick prototypes -- Highcharts, three.js, d3.js.](/posts/dash-voila-panel-streamlit-our-thoughts-on-the-big-four-dashboarding-tools/big-four-img-2.png)

## Short Detour Into Python Data Visualization Landscape

When thinking about Python data visualization, it is useful to make the
distinction between the core visualization libraries that let you build
individual charts or plots, and the dashboarding tools that let you arrange
these charts and plots into an interactive application. As you can see in the
figure below, there are lots of core visualization libraries in the PyData
ecosystem.

The landscape might be intimidating, but it demonstrates the richness and
diversity of tools available to those who know how to use them. For help
navigating the options, the community has created [PyViz][pyviz homepage] to
help.

Broadly speaking, these tools target high performance visualization on GPUs, web
browser based interactive visualizations, and print/publication quality static
visualizations. At the core of these three categories are tools that wrap around
OpenGL, Javascript, and Matplotlib respectively.

Our focus today is on the web browser tools. These will be the building blocks
of our interactive dashboards. Many of these tools are influenced by the concept
of the [Grammar of Graphics][grammar of graphics].

## Python Dashboarding Options

### A Little Bit of History

Over the last few years, there has been rapid growth in the Python interactive
dashboarding space and with that we now have four very good options to choose
from: Dash, Voila, Panel, and Streamlit.

If we consider the popularity of each as measured by downloads per month, we
have Streamlit in the lead with 972,000 a month, followed by Dash with 902,000,
Panel with 468,000, and finally Voila with 62,000
([source][pyviz dashboarding tools info]). Although these numbers are worth
noting, this is a reductive way of looking at each choice.

All four libraries are great for simple dashboards, but as you start using them
heavily, the differences become apparent. They each started in one corner of the
ring (so to speak) and expanded into other areas.

This is why our discussion covers the roots of these four solutions. These roots
are where they are strongest even though they have each crossed over into new
domains. A key consideration here is compatibility with
[Jupyter][jupyter homepage], one of the primary tools used for exploratory data
science.

One example of this is with Dash, created by [Plotly][plotly homepage]. Initial
versions did not work with Jupyter but now there is an extension that enables
some Jupyter functionality. Similarly, Panel originally did not have an instant
preview, but now it does.

### Dash

[Dash was announced][dash announcement] in 2017 and is primarily a dashboarding
solution for visualizations using the Plotly library. If you are not interested
in Plotly then stop here, but if you like the Plotly library then it can be a
good choice.

Dash is designed mainly to build standalone dashboards outside of Jupyter. It
exposes a lot more of the underlying HTML, CSS, and Javascript to the user than
most of the other solutions. From experience and based on client feedback, many
find it hard to develop and maintain Plotly/Dash dashboards without frontend web
developer experience on the team.

Dash stores all per-user state in the client (browser), which means for certain
types of dashboards, it can be highly scalable, allowing many simultaneous
client sessions without necessarily using up resources on the server for each
new client. On the flip side, this also makes it more difficult to program, and
less optimized for complex pipelines and big data problems. Dash originally did
not work with Jupyter, but they recently released a Jupyter extension that
enables some basic Jupyter integration.

### Voila

[Voila was announced][voila announcement] in June 2019 with the explicit goal of
providing a dashboarding solution based on Jupyter Notebooks. Voila was created
by QuantStack, the core developers of the [ipywidgets][ipywidgets docs]
interactive toolkit that was the original method of interactivity inside Jupyter
Notebooks.

In some sense, Voila is the simplest of the four choices. It redisplays all the
output cells of your Jupyter Notebook based on a templated layout. This means
that any Jupyter Notebook can also be a Voila dashboard. It also means that care
must be taken to suppress output in the notebook that you do not want visible in
the final dashboard.

Creating templates typically requires some knowledge with HTML/CSS/JS, but newer
layout tools like [jupyter-flex][jupyter-flex repo] let you create the layout
with a combination of markdown and Jupyter cell tags. There are also some
template libraries like [voila-vuetify][voila-vuetify repo] that let Voila use
[vuetify][ipyvuetify repo] UI components. More complex dashboards with multiple
interacting parts are harder to build.

### Panel

[Panel was announced][panel announcement] in May of 2019 to connect data
scientists with tools for deploying the output of their analysis and models with
internal or external consumers of the analysis without having to learn
completely different technology stacks or getting into the weeds of web
development.

In terms of visibility, Panel is often overlooked, but it is the best suited for
enabling users to build fully fledged data applications. Panel is designed to be
used purely in Python with no HTML/CSS or Javascript knowledge needed. It
integrates with all the major Python visualization libraries and allows users to
build complex multi-step and multi-page workflows and applications. It also is
well integrated with core Python big data tools like Dask and Datashader. Panel
can be used inside Jupyter and is also easy to develop in a traditional IDE.
Recently, the team added instant preview capabilities similar to those that
Streamlit is famous for.

Historically, the main drawback with Panel has been its more
pedestrian/functional aesthetic compared to some of the other options. It can be
harder to make Panel dashboards look as pretty as some of the others that let
you delve deep into the HTML/CSS. This situation has improved recently, with
customizable templates that can be built from scratch or that utilize common
frameworks like FastUI, etc. Additionally, Panel has a simple imperative API
that is easy to pick up but its more powerful, declarative API for complex
applications can have a bit of a learning curve.

As an aside, Panel is the tool that I personally reach for when I’m building
exploratory data analytics tools. For further reading, I recommend Marc Skov
Madsen’s recent blog post about
[using Panel for Data Apps][using panel for data apps].

### Streamlit

[Streamlit was announced][streamlit announcement] in October 2019 as a framework
to turn scripts into beautiful tools. This concept also drives its core
strengths—simple dashboards based on a linear workflow (i.e., a script) that
look really good.

Streamlit is designed around the paradigm of interactive chart building, i.e.
you start writing snippets of code in a Python file and you see your end result
automatically updating as you are adding lines to your script. This tight
feedback loop makes it popular among users since it can feel very responsive to
use and you can build things fast. It is targeted at pure Python users. Users do
not have to think about layout.

Originally, it had a simple top-to-bottom layout with a sidebar for widgets, but
in late 2020 they introduced four layout options that provided some flexibility.
Streamlit assumes Python code is written in an editor; code written in Jupyter
needs to be exported to Python with all Jupyter Magics stripped out. More
complex dashboards with multiple interacting parts are much harder to build.

Streamlit was recently [acquired by Snowflake][snowflake acquires streamlit] and
it will be interesting to see where it goes with the influx of capital, and
whether it will become more closely tied to Snowflake databases.

## Answers to Questions We Get a Lot

### Which one should I use?

This is the big question. To answer this, you should think about what you are
trying to enable and the composition of your team. Each of them can be a good
choice and in many cases you can use them interchangeably without mandating that
a single one be used across an organization. Consider the below as you decide:

- If you’re publishing with Jupyter Notebooks, go with Voila or Panel.

- If you’re looking to work in an IDE with .py files, consider Streamlit, Dash,
  or Panel.

- If you’re building complex apps with the support of a dev team and the Plotly
  charting library is sufficient for your needs, Dash is for you.

- If you want to build multi-page apps in Python using data-science-friendly
  tools, then choose Panel.

### Which is the best for performance and scalability?

First let’s define performance/scaling; this can be divided into two areas.
First is the number of simultaneous users in a single deployed dashboard, and
second is how large a dataset the dashboard can handle. Also at some point, if
performance becomes critical, it will make sense to rewrite the application
directly in Javascript.

In terms of the number of simultaneous users, Voila and Streamlit do not scale
well. For instance, Voila requires a completely new Python interpreter process
for each new visitor to the app, which makes startup slow and users compete for
memory. Because performance-intensive computations generally also require
memory, Voila and Streamlit will generally only work well for small numbers of
visitors.

On the other end, Dash stores all per-user states in the client (browser) which
means for certain types of dashboards, it can be highly scalable, allowing many
simultaneous dashboard users without using up server resources. Panel is in the
middle, it scales reasonably well but not to the extent of Dash, unless your
dashboard is specifically optimized for that case.

For big data problems, Panel is a clear winner with native support for
Datashader and Dask, and allows for highly scalable dashboards and pipelines
backed by compute clusters, cloud servers, and/or GPUs. Dash Enterprise claims
to support connections to the most popular "big data" back ends for Python,
including Vaex, Dask, Datashader, RAPIDS, Databricks (PySpark), Snowflake,
Postgres, and Salesforce.

These integrations seem to be locked into the Enterprise edition, and it is
unclear whether these can be used with the open source version. Voila can be
used with tools like Vaex and Datashader but the learning curve is higher.
Finally, Streamlit is primarily designed for data that can fit within memory.

### Can I build a multi-page app with it?

- Voila is not designed for multi-page apps.

- Streamlit was not originally designed for multi-page apps, and despite some
  blog posts and [discussion][streamlit discussion on multipage] around hacks
  that make it possible, it is still not straightforward to build such apps.

- Plotly and Dash support [multi-page apps][dash multipage support], but
  building such apps requires deep HTML/web knowledge and careful reasoning
  about callbacks, events, and collecting data because of the constraint of
  having a stateless serving model.

- Panel offers several options for building multi-page apps, including
  [Pipelines][panel pipelines], a wrapper which allows individual app “pages” to
  be connected (with data flowing between them) and presented to the user in
  sequence. These can be built/prototyped in multiple cells in a Jupyter
  Notebook and deployed as a multi-page app. It can handle diverging and
  converging flows. Essentially, you can define a DAG in Python and what data
  needs to pass between each stage of the app. Panel can also easily host
  collections of independent dashboards and apps from a central overview page.
  Other custom multi-page apps can also be built, with more work.

### Which is more suitable for non-coders/beginners?

None of these options are designed for non-coders. All of them assume the user
has enough Python experience to build plots and charts out of the underlying
Python visualization libraries. Typically, non-coders should use the BI Tools
mentioned above.

[Lumen][lumen repo] is an interesting new open source tool that builds on top of
Panel and has a BI style UI under development that looks promising. With
Snowflake's recent acquisition of Streamlit, we speculate they may move in that
direction as well.

Now for beginner/less experienced coders, Voila, Streamlit, and Panel are all
good choices, with the caveat that if they prefer Jupyter as an interface, then
Voila and Panel are better options. Dash should be avoided unless there is a web
development team working with the beginners.

### How easy is it to implement authorization and authentication for the dashboards?

For most organizations, we don't recommend that the dashboard solution be
responsible for performing authentication and authorization. Instead, they
should delegate this responsibility to a service.
[ContainDS Dashboards][containds docs] is an example of a JupyterHub Extension
that does this in a dashboard agnostic way. If done via the web server, the
following tools can also be used to provide authentication and authorization for
any of the dashboarding libraries:

- [traefik-forward-auth][traefik-forward-auth repo]

- [oauth2-proxy][oauth2-proxy docs]

- [pycasbin][pycasbin repo]

If you do want the dashboarding library to handle authentication, some of them
have built in options of varying maturity.

- Panel is built on Bokeh which offers authentication, and Panel ships with a
  range of OAuth providers, e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Okta, Azure (see [Panel's
  authentication guide][panel auth guide]).

- Dash has a basic auth system in the open source version and a more
  comprehensive enterprise version (see
  [Dash’s authentication guide][dash authentication guide]).

- Voila can reuse JupyterHub’s authentication if you are on a JupyterHub
  instance.

- Streamlit provides authentication in their cloud product and there are some
  third party solutions.
