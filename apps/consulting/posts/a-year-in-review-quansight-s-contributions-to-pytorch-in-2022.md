description: '2022 was an exciting year for the PyTorch ecosystem. The PyTorch project joining the Linux Foundation was a major milestone, and PyTorch 2.0 was announced with loads of informative talks from the maintainers explaining new features. Additionally, there was marked progress on areas including sparse tensors, JAX-like transformations in PyTorch were released, and TorchVision announced a new Transforms API. In this post, we will review how Quansight has been working hand-in-hand with the PyTorch team at Meta to enhance the PyTorch Project in regards to the above, and beyond.'
