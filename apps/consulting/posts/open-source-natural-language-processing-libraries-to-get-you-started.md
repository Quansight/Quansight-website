The relatively recent advancements in open source Artificial Intelligence (AI)
technologies is revolutionary and demonstrable of producing unrivaled value to
computing. Chief among the subsets of AI is Natural Language Processing (NLP),
which constitutes my primary focus and area of expertise. I am also an ardent
advocate of Open Source Software (OSS), so it follows that I believe AI ought to
be both transparent and inclusive. NLP not only fits this belief, it has
arguably been one of the domains of AI that has benefited from the openness and
ubiquity of OSS the most.

In this post, I will explain the subtle nuances among popular OSS NLP libraries,
namely Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), SpaCy, and Spark NLP, and comment on
their relative performance and specific applications. My preference for
discussing these three libraries is informed by the following observations: how
intuitive the library seems to be, their general performance, their overall
strengths, and how well-maintained their open source repositories are.

The goal with this post is to assist those who are just getting started with
NLP, whether your motivation is for your own recreational learning or whether it
is to enhance the profitability of your business.

## OSS in AI

Although the genesis of AI dates back to the 1950s — when Alan Turing published
his seminal paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” hypothesizing whether
machines possess the capacity to think, learn and demonstrate reason, and Frank
Rosenblatt invented the “perceptron algorithm,” formulating the basis for binary
classification — it was not until recently that AI made a quantum leap.

Notwithstanding the significance of such AI pioneers’ contributions, the field
of AI had remained largely stagnant for decades, suffering through what was
called the AI Winter. The recent advancements in AI, particularly in Deep
Learning and its wide range of applications, have become possible not only
because of the unprecedented computing power of modern graphics processing units
(GPUs) but also thanks to OSS, representing remarkable collective intelligence
in the service of AI.

Community-driven open source libraries, such as scikit-learn and pandas, as well
as company-backed open source AI frameworks, like TensorFlow and PyTorch, have
accelerated AI advancement. They have enhanced the ability of AI practitioners,
machine learning engineers, computer and data scientists to create and make use
of AI applications in industry, academia, and scientific research. The impact of
OSS in AI is also indicated when considering that Python has become the language
of choice to represent AI. This is greatly due to Python’s extensive scientific
computing ecosystem, which is mainly powered by the flexibility of OSS.

## Why NLP Is Indispensable
