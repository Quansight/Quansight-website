Imagine having a dataset of over 50 TB of compressed geospatial point data
stored in flat files, and you want to efficiently filter data in a few ZIP codes
for further processing. You can't even open a dataset that large on a single
machine using tools like pandas, so what is the best way to accomplish the
filtering? This is exactly the problem one of our clients recently faced.

We addressed this challenge by spatially sorting the data, storing it in a
partitionable binary file format, and parallelizing spatial filtering of the
data all while using only open source tools within the PyData ecosystem on a
commercial cloud platform. This white paper documents the potential solutions
that we considered to address our client's needs.

## Potential Approaches

Our client was a small startup who needed to avoid large up-front infrastructure
costs. This constrained our approaches to those possible via cloud providers
like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We considered five potential
approaches to meet the client's needs, one of which employs a relational
database, and four that use the PyData stack.

## Relational Database With Geospatial Extension

Perhaps the first approach that comes to mind is the use of a relational
database such as PostgreSQL and an extension like PostGIS which allows the use
of spatial data types and queries on AWS Relational Database Service (RDS). The
advantage of this approach is that it's well established, but the strong
disadvantage is cost.

Databases hosted on AWS RDS have a variety of costs, but in this case, with such
a large amount of data, database storage costs dominate. Using RDS requires
using more expensive database storage rather than using S3 storage. Table 1
below compares the costs of RDS Database Storage and S3 Storage at the time of
writing.

<div class="text-center"><em>Table 1. Comparison of AWS Storage Costs</em></div>

<BlogTable
tableDivClassName='w-2/3'
headingData={['', 'RDS Database', 'S3']}
tableData={[
['Per GB-Month', '$0.115', '$0.023'],
['Per 50 TB-Month', '$5,750', '$1,150']
]}
/>

Database storage is 5x the cost of S3 storage making an RDS database approach
unattractive. Approaches that allow the data to be accessed directly from S3 are
more cost effective. This cost difference led us to consider the PyData stack.

## PyData Stack

In this approach, building a solution using open-source libraries is more cost
effective and transparent, but it's more than that for us at Quansight. We are
experts in the PyData open source tool stack. Many core contributors and
creators of popular Python open source packages have found a home at Quansight.
We often see solutions that make significant use of open source tools, so
naturally this is where we focused the remainder of our development.

Various open source Python packages exist which could be combined to accomplish
spatial sorting. We built several solutions and compared their performances
below. Generally, each solution consists of five components, which are
illustrated in Figure 2.

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-3.png)

_Figure 2: Illustration of the general workflow for solutions based on the PyData stack approach._

The five components are:

1. Use a partitionable binary file format
2. Spatially sort the dataset
3. Create a global data index
4. Parallelize data access and processing
5. Spatially filter the relevant partitions

We chose these components generally to reduce memory use and increase filtering
speed. The first component, a partitionable binary file format, was useful
because partitions allow for subsets of the data to be read. The second
component was spatial sorting. This is the process of mapping 2-dimensional data
to a single dimension such that points near each other in the single dimension
are near each other in the original 2-dimensions, and then sorting the data by
that single dimension. The third component, creating a global index of the
partitions, allows for efficient lookup of the partitions which contain data in
a particular region. After the data was sorted and indexed, it was saved in
partitions, which could be opened individually instead of opening the entire
dataset at once. With the data in that format, filtering (by ZIP code polygons
in this paper) was much faster because we only needed to open the data
partitions relevant to a specific region. The fourth component was parallelized
access and processing of the relevant partitions. The relevant partitions of the
dataset include points both within and outside the set of ZIP code polygons. The
fifth component, another filtering step, was necessary to exclude data outside
the ZIP code polygons.

## Spatial Sorting

Spatial sorting deserves more explanation, and it can be performed using a
variety of techniques. The idea is to map the original point data from
latitude-longitude space to a 1-dimensional space such that points that are near
each other in the 1-dimensional space are also near each other in
latitude-longitude space. We can then sort the points based on the 1-dimensional
space value. If that isn't clear, the coming examples describing geohash and
Hilbert curve spatial sorting should help.

Several established systems could be used for spatially sorting the data including [Geohash][geohash], [Hilbert Curve][hilbert], [Uber H3][uber h3], and [Google S2 Geometry][google s2 geometry]. We only considered the first two methods due to time constraints, but they are conceptually similar to the last two methods.

### _Geohash Spatial Sort Example_

Using geohashes is the first way we considered spatially sorting the point data,
but what is a geohash? In practical terms, a geohash is a string of characters
which represents a rectangular region in latitude-longitude space. In Figure 3,
geohash “9” represents the area contained in the red rectangle. Smaller and
smaller subregions can be defined within the larger geohash by adding more
characters. You can see that the geohash “9q” represents the region in the light
blue rectangle which is contained within geohash “9”. You can continue adding
characters to the geohash to define an arbitrarily small subregion.

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-4.png)

_Figure 3: Background: Select one-character geohash regions plotted over a world
map. Inset: All two-character geohashes starting with “9” as the first character
plotted over a map._

To spatially sort the data with geohashes, we mapped each point to its four
character geohash, and then sorted the geohashes
[lexicographically][lexicographically]. This results in the 2D
latitude-longitude space being mapped to a 1D geohash space (string of
characters) which can be sorted. The power of this method depended on the fact
that points near each other in geohash space are also near each other in
latitude-longitude space.

### _Hilbert Curve Spatial Sort Example_

Instead of using geohashes, the point data could be spatially sorted via a
Hilbert curve. In Figure 4, the Hilbert curve (red), is a continuous curve
beginning in the bottom left, and ending in the bottom right which fills the 2D
latitude-longitude space. If we snap our point data, to the nearest part of the
Hilbert curve, we can define each point by the distance it lies along the
Hilbert curve. We can then sort the data by the 1D Hilbert curve distance. After
doing so, we've mapped our 2D latitude-longitude data to a 1D Hilbert curve
distance dimension, and points which are near each other on the Hilbert curve
are also near each other in latitude-longitude space.

latitude-longitude coordinate system. The red curvy line is the Hilbert curve
inside the box. The points are arbitrary examples showing where they might lie
relative to the curve._

## Tech Stacks Used in PyData Solutions

Now that the components of the general approach have been explained, let's get
into the specific packages implemented in the four solutions we tested. We
conducted performance tests on the following stacks (Table 2) to help determine
the best solution for our client.

<div class="pl-20"><em>Table 2: Packages used in each spatial filtering solution.</em></div>

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-6.png)

<div class="pl-20"><em><sup>*</sup>Sorted Geohash No Sjoin is not as accurate as the other solutions.</em></div>

[Parquet][parquet docs] was used in all four potential solutions as the binary
file format allowing partitioning of the data for subsequently accessing only
relevant data partitions. For spatial sorting, solutions using both geohashes
via [Python-Geohash][python-geohash pypi] and the Hilbert curve via
[Spatialpandas][spatialpandas repo] were considered. [Dask][dask docs] was used
to build a global index of the data in the geohash sorted solutions, while
Spatialpandas built the global index of the data in the Hilbert curve solution.
Dask is used to read the data in parallel in all cases. Additionally, Dask is
used to map the spatial filtering function across each of the data partitions in
all cases. The spatial filtering function, a spatial join (explained below), was
part of [GeoPandas][geopandas docs] in the first 2 cases, and part of
Spatialpandas in the last case. In the Sorted Geohash No Sjoin case, no final
spatial filtering was performed, resulting in a lower-accuracy solution than the
other cases.

The spatial filtering function used in the last step was a spatial join. A
spatial join is like a regular database join, except the keys being joined are
geometric objects and the relationships between them can include geometric
relationships (e.g., 'join by points within a polygon'). Different spatial join
methods are implemented in GeoPandas and Spatialpandas.

## Benchmark

In order to compare the various solutions, we established a benchmark against
which to compare the solution performances in terms of runtime. The task is to
filter a large amount of point data by various randomly selected US ZIP code
polygons. We performed the task five times for each solution, each time
increasing the number of ZIP code polygons. The dataset and machine
specification details are given below. Our work can be freely downloaded and
reproduced from [this GitHub repository][scipy2020 repo].

**Each benchmarking test follows these steps:**

Preprocess data (if necessary) one time:

1. Calculate geohash or Hilbert curve
2. Spatially sort data
3. Save data in partitions

Filter data for each query:

1. Select points from dataset that are within 1, 10, 100, 1000, or 10,000 random
   ZIP code polygons distributed around the contiguous US

### _Dataset_

We used a [dataset from OpenStreetMap (OSM)][gps points] (direct download link), which originally
consisted of 2.9 billion latitude-longitude point pairs. We removed data outside
the contiguous US, leaving 114 million rows of point data in a 3.2 GB
uncompressed CSV file. We then converted the data to a Parquet file format. The
polygons are randomly selected US ZIP code polygons available from the
[US Census][polygons] (direct download link, via archive.org).

### _Machine Specifications_

Although a cloud cluster was used in production, the benchmark results presented
here were performed on a workstation. The specs are included below:

- Processor: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2970WX 24-Core Processor
- RAM: 64 GB
- For this comparison Dask Workers were limited to:
  - 4 Workers
  - 2 Threads per Worker
  - 3 GB RAM per Worker

Note that the final computation brings the filtered data into the main process
potentially using more RAM than an individual worker has.

## Benchmark Results

### _Unsorted Case_

As a baseline, we timed an unsorted case first. In this case, preprocessing and
sorting of the data was not necessary. We simply opened up every partition of
the data, and used GeoPandas to spatially join each partition of points with the
set of ZIP code polygons. We spatially joined the partitions in parallel with
Dask. The results are in Table 3.

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-7.png)

Each row contains the results of filtering the 114 million initial points by a
different number of ZIP code polygons. Because this baseline does not require
preprocessing, the Geohash and sort times are each 0 seconds. The query times
were all above 40 minutes, and increased with increasing numbers of ZIP code
polygons. The workers didn't have enough memory to filter by 1000 or 10,000 ZIP
code polygons.

### _Sorted Geohash With Sjoin Case_

The next case used Python-Geohash to create geohashes for each point in our OSM
dataset. Remember that this means each point in our dataset was labeled with a
string of characters representing its location. Then, Dask was used to sort and
index the data by the geohash labels. The geohash calculation and sorting times
are one-time costs for a given dataset of points. The remaining steps must be
performed each time a query is made, and are explained with the help of Figure 6
below.

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-8.png)

_Figure 6: Illustration showing the spatial features involved in querying data
in the sorted geohash case._

In Figure 6, there is a bright red region representing a ZIP code area. The
light blue and dark blue points are the subset of the points from our OSM
dataset that lie within the pink geohashes (two, side-by-side) which intersect
the ZIP code area. Our goal was to efficiently return the light blue points,
those that intersect the ZIP code area. This was accomplished by opening only
the data in the geohashes (partitions) intersecting the ZIP code polygon (light
and dark blue points) using the global index of our spatially sorted data, and
then applying spatial filtering to leave only the light blue points.

In terms of our PyData stack, we first find the geohash polygons which intersect
the ZIP code with Polygon-geohasher. Then we open our dataset with Dask. Dask
uses its global index to open the partitions of our dataset corresponding to the
geohash polygons (dark blue points). Then we used GeoPandas to perform a spatial
join between the ZIP code polygon and the geohash points to exclude points
outside of the ZIP code polygon and keep the points of interest (light blue
points). The benchmark results are below.

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-9.png)

The one-time costs alone (30 min) are less than the single query time (~40 min)
in the unsorted case (above), and this case was able to filter the data in the
1000 ZIP code polygon task. It's important to note that the numbers of filtered
data points are identical to the unsorted case, giving us confidence that we
selected the same points.

### _Sorted Geohash No Sjoin Case_

As the number of ZIP code polygons grows, the last spatial join step takes
longer and longer. For some applications, the last spatial join step may not be
necessary. The lower accuracy of returning all points that are near the ZIP code
polygons, rather than only those within the ZIP code polygons reduces the query
time significantly. In Figure 6, this solution would return all the light and
dark blue points within the geohashes intersecting the ZIP code rather than just
those light blue points within the ZIP code. This solution is not adequate in
all cases, but the reduced query time may be worth it in some use cases. For
example, this solution may be adequate when the uncertainty of the point data is
greater than the size of the geohashes. The results of leaving off the last
spatial join step are below.

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-10.png)

In this case, the query times are much lower, especially when the number of ZIP
code polygons is higher, but the number of result points is also much larger,
indicative of the lower filtering precision produced by excluding the last
spatial join step.

### _Spatialpandas Case_

The last case used a new package called [Spatialpandas][spatialpandas repo].
Spatialpandas spatially sorts the data using the Hilbert curve. The results of
using Spatialpandas are below. It wasn't possible to separate the preprocessing
time from the spatial sort time in this case, so they are included together in
the sort time column.

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-11.png)

_\* Geohash time and sort time are combined because they could not be determined
separately with Spatialpandas._

This case was much faster than the other cases. Additionally, this was the only
case that could filter the data by the 10,000 polygon set with full accuracy.
This is because the Spatialpandas spatial join requires less memory than the
GeoPandas spatial join method.

## Benchmark Result Comparison

We've looked at the results individually, but the following plots compare the
performances of the potential solutions. The first plot below shows the query
times vs the number of ZIP code polygons by which the data was being filtered.
Query times don't include the one time costs like calculating geohashes, the
Hilbert curve, or sorting the data.

As shown in Figure 7, the query time for the unsorted case (red) took the
longest at over 40 minutes, and this case was not able to process the two
largest batches of ZIP code polygons. The query time for the sorted geohash
without spatial join (yellow) was the fastest for 100 or more polygons, but
remember that it wasn't as accurate as the other solutions. The fastest query
time for an accurate solution is the Spatialpandas case (green).

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-12.png)

_Figure 7: Comparison of filtering time for each batch of ZIP code polygons. The
dashed line indicates the case in which a spatial join was not used and the
results are typically less accurate._

Having looked at query times, now let's look at the one-time preprocessing times
shown in Figure 8. No preprocessing was necessary for the unsorted case, so the
preprocessing time was 0 minutes. The two sorted geohash cases had the same
preprocessing steps and are identical as a result. In the sorted geohash cases,
the geohash calculation took 27 minutes, and the sorting took 3 minutes. By
contrast, in the Spatialpandas case the preprocessing and sorting steps took
just over 1 minute.

_Figure 8: Preprocessing times for the Sorted Geohash and Spatialpandas
solutions. For Spatialpandas, the sort time includes the preprocessing time._

Figure 9 shows the extrapolated total time (preprocessing + query time) vs the
number of queries when filtering the data by 1, 100, and 10,000 polygons in each
query. Query times are extrapolated under the assumption of linear scaling of
queries based on the results of the single query time.

![](/posts/spatial-filtering-at-scale-with-dask-and-spatialpandas/spacialpandas-img-14.png)

_Figure 9: Extrapolated total time vs number of queries using 1 polygon (left),
100 polygons (middle), and 10,000 polygons (right) in each query._

Of the approaches with highest accuracy, the Spatialpandas solution is projected
to be fastest in all situations. At times, the Sorted Geohash No Sjoin solution
has lower total time than Spatialpandas, but this comes at the potentially high
cost of accuracy.

## Additional Considerations

Spatialpandas was the best overall solution explored here, and was what we ended
up using for our client. Spatialpandas is an easy to install, pure Python
package. It makes heavy use of Numba for highly efficient spatial joins and
bounding box queries. It's also integrated nicely with Dask and the Parquet file
format.

However, there are additional considerations to keep in mind. Spatialpandas is a
young project with a small community at the moment. The documentation is limited
compared with more established libraries, and it has low development activity
for the moment. Spatialpandas is good at what it does, but it's also limited in
functionality. If you need Spatialpandas to do something similar, but slightly
different from what is shown here, you may be forced to implement changes to the
library yourself. Keep these considerations in mind if you're thinking of using
Spatialpandas in your application.

## Other Approaches Considered: AWS Athena, Omnisci and NVIDIA RAPIDS

We considered and experimented with a few other approaches. AWS Athena is a
serverless interactive query service allowing users to query datasets residing
in S3 via SQL queries. Though promising, at the time Athena had file size
limitations that made it impractical for this use-case and also did not obviate
the need to sort and partition the data spatially to improve access times. The
other main area considered was GPU acceleration. We explored two technologies
for this, [OmniSci][omnisci docs] and [NVIDIA RAPIDS][rapids page]. These showed
some promise but turned out to be too expensive to be practical. Omnisci has
excellent GPU accelerated geospatial query performance but requires a fairly
beefy GPU instance to run and requires that the data be imported into its
internal format, which also increases storage costs over S3. The NVIDIA RAPIDS
suite has a new tool called CuSpatial, but in practice it was a very early
prototype and not usable in production.
