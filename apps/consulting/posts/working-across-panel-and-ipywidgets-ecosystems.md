_This post is adapted from a notebook designed to help you learn how to make
apps in Panel in about 15 minutes. Screenshots of cell outputs are included for
convenience below, but it is **strongly** recommended that you use the
[interactive Binder version][demo binder] (takes 1-2 minutes to load) or clone
the [repo][demo repo] to run the demo locally._

[Panel][panel site] is a open-source Python library that makes it easy to build
interactive web apps and dashboards with flexible user-defined widgets. The
Panel library makes a broad range of widgets available. However, did you know
that you can also use widgets from the [ipywidgets][ipywidgets docs] library
with Panel seamlessly?

## What Are Widgets?

For our purposes, a widget is a component of a graphical user interface (GUI)
that enables easy interaction with the application (e.g., a drop-down menu for
selecting from a set of items or a slider for specifying a numeric value). Until
recently, GUI authors had to choose between strictly using Panel or strictly
using ipywidgets because each ecosystem had distinct widget patterns;
fortunately, that is no longer the case. The union of these ecosystems opens up
enormous possibilities for designing flexible GUIs (both in notebooks and in web
applications).

## Panel and ipywidgets Demonstration

We'll show you an example in this notebook that uses widgets from ipywidgets
within a Panel app. We are going to modify an
[example Panel app][panel example app] for exploring the
[autompg dataset][autompg dataset] included with the Bokeh package by switching
out the `Panel.ColorPicker` widget with the `ipywidgets.ColorPicker` widget.
Just for fun, we'll also add in widgets from ipywidgets to change the size and
shape of the markers in a scatter plot.

```python
import hvplot.pandas, panel, ipywidgets
from bokeh.sampledata.autompg import autompg

panel.extension()
```

`autompg` is a pandas `DataFrame`, so we can sample a few leading rows to see
what the columns are:

```python
autompg.head()
```

## Widgets With Panel and hvPlot

The `hvplot` accessor enables simple ways to produce plots from the `autompg`
dataframe. For instance, we can make a scatter plot using the `mpg` and `hp`
features. We'll use the resulting plot as a template to develop a GUI for
exploring the `autompg` dataset.

```python
autompg.hvplot.scatter("mpg", "hp")
```

First, let's define a few Panel widgets to manipulate the preceding plot. The
`Select` widgets `x_col` and `y_col` are drop-down menus to select numerical
columns from the `autompg` dataframe for the horizontal and vertical axes of a
scatter plot.

```python
# Define keyword argument 'options' for both Select widgets
cols = autompg.columns
opts = {"options": list(cols.drop(["origin", "name"]))}
print(opts)
```

`{'options': ['mpg', 'cyl', 'displ', 'hp', 'weight', 'accel', 'yr']}`

```python
# Define the relevant Panel widgets
x_col = Panel.widgets.Select(value="mpg", name="x", **opts)
y_col = Panel.widgets.Select(value="hp", name="y", **opts)
```

## Widgets With ipywidgets

Next, let's define some widgets drawn from the ipywidgets library.

The first one, `color`, is used to choose the color of markers in the scatter
plot.

```python
color = ipywidgets.widgets.ColorPicker(
    description="Pick a color",
    value="blue",
)
```

Next, the object `size` is instantiated as an `ipywidgets.IntSlider`, for
adjusting the marker size in the scatter plot.

```python
size = ipywidgets.IntSlider(
    value=7,
    min=0,
    max=50,
    step=1,
    description="Point size:",
    disabled=False,
    orientation="horizontal",
)
```

We can also create an object `marker` using `ipywidgets.Dropdown` to provide
options for choosing different marker symbols in the scatter plot.

```python
marker = ipywidgets.Dropdown(
    options=list("*d^v><x"),
    value="*",
    description="Symbol:",
    disabled=False,
)
```

## Linking Interactions in Each Ecosystem

We can now connect all the widget objects instantiated so far. In particular,
the decorated function `autompg_plot` combines the Panel `Select` objects
`x_col` and `y_col` together with the ipywidgets objects `color`, `size`, and
`marker` to construct an explicit call to `autompg.hvplot.scatter`.

For context, the `Panel.depends` decorator wrapping `autompg_plot` produces a
function that is revaluated whenever any of the specified widget objects
(`x_col`, `y_col`, `color`, `size`, and `marker`) are changed by the user. As
such, the resulting scatter plot is updated too.

```python
@panel.depends(x_col, y_col, color, size, marker)
def autompg_plot(x_col, y_col, color, size, marker):
    new_plot = autompg.hvplot.scatter(x_col, y_col, c=color, size=size, marker=marker)
    return new_plot
```

Finally, we can create a useful Panel app layout for the application. With the
objects `Panel.Row` and `Panel.Column` nested as below, we will have a single
row composed of a column of widgets on the left and the associated scatter plot
on the right. More specifically, from top to bottom, the left-hand column has
Markdown text at the top, two drop-down menus beneath, then a color picker, a
slider, and finally another drop-down menu at the bottom. Notice again that the
Panel application combines widgets from both the ipywidgets and the Panel
ecosystems.

```python
Panel.Row(
    Panel.Column(
        '## MPG Explorer', x_col, y_col,
        color, size, marker
    ), autompg_plot
)
```

## Conclusion

When building a Panel app or dashboard, embedding widgets from ipywidgets is
just as simple as using Panel widgets only! This greatly broadens the number of
widgets and different styling options available.
