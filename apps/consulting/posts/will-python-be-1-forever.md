Based on the data collected by [PYPL][pypl page] and shown in the chart below,
over the last 5 years, PHP and Java declined in popularity while Python’s
popularity rose. Sometime in 2018, Python became the most popular language. But
Python probably won’t be #1 forever. If history is any indication, no language
can maintain the premier position in language popularity indefinitely. I’m sure
there were many who believed that Java would never be replaced as #1.

But that certainly does not mean that Python is going away completely. Virtually
none of the languages that have come to prominence in the past have disappeared
yet. They continue on as legacy code. Looking at the bottom right of the same
chart, we see that people are still learning to code in Cobol and Ada. The last
Cobol programmer on the planet will probably be the highest paid programmer on
the planet. We also see that new-comer, Rust, is quickly climbing the chart.
Will it be the new #1 someday?
