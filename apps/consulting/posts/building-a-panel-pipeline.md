Over a number of recent posts, we have given some examples of <a
href="/post/quick-dashboarding-with-panel" target="_self">how to build
dashboards</a> using [Panel][panel site] and <a
href="/post/working-across-panel-and-ipywidgets-ecosystems" target="_self">how
to integrate widgets from Panel and ipywidgets</a> into the same Panel app.
These have all been _one-stage_ examples, but you can actually use Panel to
build a [_pipeline_ of stages][panel user guide: pipelines] with information
carried over from one stage to the next. You can think of these stages as
different pages on a website.

In this post, we present an example of a simple pipeline using Panel to
illustrate how easy it is to put in place.

## Instantiating the Pipeline

We start by importing Panel, then instantiating a Panel `Pipeline` object called
`pipeline`. In this instance, we include the `inherit_params` parameter, setting
it to `False`. If `inherit_params` is `True`, then parameters declared on
consecutive stages are inherited. It will not matter in our simple example, but
enabling inherited parameters across pipeline stages may be useful in some
application contexts.

```python
import panel as pn

pn.extension()

pipeline = pn.pipeline.Pipeline(inherit_params=False)
```

## Building Stages

Next, we can add stages to the pipeline. To do so, we need to build the additional stages explicitly.

To construct a Panel pipeline, we need to create _parameterized classes_ (i.e.,
classes that inherit from the `param.Parameterized` class from the
[Param][param site] library). Param enables declarative programming in Python;
that is, we can simply state facts about our parameters and then use them
throughout our code. Within Panel apps, the `panel.depends` decorator function
links parameter values to callback functions to update the state of the Panel
app. In Panel pipelines, the `param.output` decorator function links computed
values between successive stages. The parameters received at a given stage in a
pipeline must be declared consistently to consume output from the previous
stage.

In addition, we need a `panel` method in each stage of the pipeline to
determine the layout of panes and widgets in the Panel app.

The class `Stage1` defined below displays a text input widget and a continue
button. The text entered into `Stage1` is passed on to the next stage
(`Stage2`). To do this, we define a string parameter `text` and an `output`
method with the `param.output('text')` decorator. This indicates that `text` is
the output of this stage.

Notice also that we include a boolean parameter `ready` to flag when the stage
is complete and ready to proceed to the next stage. We will see how this is used
later.

The `__init__` function instantiates each of the widgets we wish to use in the
stage. Within the function, we instantiate a `TextInput` widget and a
`continue_button`. The click of the `continue_button` is connected to a callback
method `on_click_continue` defined within this class. Finally, the (variadic)
keyword arguments `**params` are passed in as an input to enable passing keyword
arguments between stages. The second stage will also need `**params` as an input
to its `__init__` function to propagate those keyword arguments onward.

The `on_click_continue` function simply sets our `ready` attribute to `True`,
which triggers the pipeline to move to the next stage.

Finally, the `panel` method is necessary to display this stage in the pipeline.
Its main purpose is to return the layout of our page.

```python
import param

class Stage1(param.Parameterized):
    ready = param.Boolean(
        default=False,
        doc="trigger for moving to the next page",
    )

    text = param.String()

    def __init__(self, **params):
        super().__init__(**params)
        self.text_input = pn.widgets.TextInput(
            name="Text Input", placeholder="Enter a string here..."
        )
        self.continue_button = pn.widgets.Button(name="Continue", button_type="primary")
        self.continue_button.on_click(self.on_click_continue)

    def on_click_continue(self, event):
        self.ready = True

    @param.output("text")
    def output(self):
        text = self.text_input.value
        return text

    def panel(self):
        return pn.Column(pn.WidgetBox(self.text_input, self.continue_button))
```

The class `Stage2` is constructed to display a single line of static text
(whatever text the user entered from `Stage1`). Notice we declare the attribute
`text` as a `param.String` as before.

```python
class Stage2(param.Parameterized):
    text = param.String()

    def __init__(self, **params):
        super().__init__(**params)
        self.text_display = pn.widgets.StaticText(
            name="Previously, you typed ", value=self.text, font_size=20
        )

    def panel(self):
        return pn.Column(
            pn.WidgetBox(self.text_display, height=50),
        )
```

## Adding Stages to the Pipeline

Now that we have defined the classes `Stage1` and `Stage2`, we can insert
instances of them into the `Pipeline` object `pipeline` instantiated above. To
do so, we make two successive calls to the `add_stage` method of `pipeline`. The
first call looks like this:

```python
pipeline.add_stage(
    name="Stage 1",
    stage=Stage1,
    ready_parameter="ready",
    auto_advance=True
)
```

The input arguments `name` and `stage` are mandatory. We chose the string
identifier _'Stage 1'_ for `name` arbitrarily (but, of course, it makes sense to
have it match the class `Stage1` passed into `stage`). We also make explicit
reference to the attribute `ready` from the class `Stage1` in the
`ready_parameter` argument. When adding a stage, we can specify the
`ready_parameter` and set `auto_advance` to `True`; this makes the pipeline
proceed to the next stage whenever the `ready_parameter` is triggered (which for
this class happens when the callback method `on_click_continue` modifies the
value of the attribute `ready`).

The next stage is added similarly:

```python
pipeline.add_stage(
    name="Stage 2",
    stage=Stage2,
)
```

After adding stages, we define the sequence of the stages by calling the
`define_graph` method. The `graph` argument to this method is a `dict` whose
key-value pairs describe the adjacency relationships of successive stages in the
pipeline (referenced by the strings _'String 1'_ and _'String 2'_ in this case).

```python
pipeline.define_graph(graph={"Stage 1": "Stage 2"})
```

Finally, we wrap a Panel `Column` object around `pipeline.stage` to specify the
layout of the pipeline. We bind the resulting object to the identifier
`example_app`, and we also chain an invocation of the `servable` method to
enable running `example_app` as a dashboard on a webserver using `panel serve`.

```python
example_app = pn.Column(pipeline.stage).servable()
```

## View the New Pipeline

Let's view our app and confirm it does what we expect:

```python
example_app
```

The first stage looks like this:

![](/posts/building-a-panel-pipeline/pipeline-img-1.png)

We can type in some sample text and click continue:

![](/posts/building-a-panel-pipeline/pipeline-img-2.png)

Our text will appear in stage 2:

![](/posts/building-a-panel-pipeline/pipeline-img-3.png)

This pipeline is about as simple as possible. The point here is to show how easy
it is to put these pieces in place. We provide an example below that includes
more complicated stages. We do everything just as above, but now, we insert
different classes in place of `Stage1` and `Stage2`.

## A Pipeline With More Complicated Stages

We have built a custom two-stage Panel app for pre-processing NLP (Natural
Language Processing) pipelines. Rather than showing the details of those two
classes as above, we have stored them in separate Python files as modules. All
we need to do is import those classes—`PreProcessor` and `Trainer`—and insert
them into our pipeline as above.

```python
from app.api import PreProcessor   # Stage 1
from app.test_train import Trainer # Stage 2
```

We construct the `Pipeline` object exactly as above. Instead of using strings
like _'Stage 1'_ and _'Stage 2'_ to label the stages, we use more meaningful
strings to describe the stages: _'Preprocess'_ and _'Training'_.

```python
import panel as pn

pn.extension()

pipeline = pn.pipeline.Pipeline(inherit_params=False)

pipeline.add_stage(
    name="Preprocess", stage=PreProcessor, ready_parameter="ready", auto_advance=True
)

pipeline.add_stage(
    name="Testing",
    stage=Trainer,
    ready_parameter="ready",
    auto_advance=True,
)

pipeline.define_graph(graph={"Preprocess": "Testing"})

sentiment_app = pn.Column(pipeline.stage).servable()
```

And now we can view our new app:

```python
sentiment_app
```

The first stage consists of a page that includes several tabs. Each can be seen
here:

![](/posts/building-a-panel-pipeline/pipeline-img-7.png)

![](/posts/building-a-panel-pipeline/pipeline-img-8.png)

After we select all the options available to us on the app, we click continue to
reveal the _Train and Test_ page.

By clicking the _Train and Test_ button, the model is processed. We can then see
the results of the model in the pane on the right-hand side.

## Final Thoughts

We hope this post on Panel Pipelines is enlightening. We can build more
elaborate stages or pipelines with more than two stages. We can even have
branching stages that depend on user input (e.g., clicking one button versus
another button makes the pipeline proceed to different stages). It's quite
flexible. We encourage you to try building a Panel pipeline app that can be
useful in your work or daily life. Not only is it fun, but we think you'll find
Panel makes it easy to put these stages into place!
