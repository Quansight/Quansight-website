You can think of these stages as different pages on a website.'

Over a number of recent posts, we have given some examples of
[how to build dashboards][qs panel dashboard post] using [Panel][panel site] and
[how to integrate widgets from Panel and ipywidgets][qs panel & ipywidgets post]
into the same Panel app. These have all been _one-stage_ examples, but you can
actually use Panel to build a
[_pipeline_ of stages][panel user guide: pipelines] with information carried
over from one stage to the next. You can think of these stages as different
pages on a website.

In this post, we present an example of a simple pipeline using Panel to
illustrate how easy it is to put in place.
